# Dielectrics 

> [!Info] Permittivity
> - Altering the properties of a capacitor changes how much charge it can store at a given voltage (its capacitance). 
> - One of the things you can change is the dielectric material separating the two conducting plates. This changes the capacitance because different materials have different relative permittivities. 
> - Permittivity is a measure of how difficult it is to generate an electric field in a medium. The higher the permittivity of a material, the more charge is needed to generate an electric field of a given size. 
> - Relative permittivity is the ratio of the permittivity of a material to the permittivity of free space:

> [!Tip] Equation for the capacitance of a capacitor 
> $$C=\frac{A\varepsilon_{0}\varepsilon_{r}}{d}$$

> [!Example] Practise Questions: Application 
> 1. $\frac{1.99\times10^{-11}}{8.85\times10^{-12}}$
> 2. $\frac{2.7\times10^{-5}\times 86\times 8.85\times10^{-12}}{0.0005}=4.10994\times 10^{-11}$
> 3. $16.6nF\times\frac{2.55}{3}=14.11nF$

> [!Example] Practise Questions: Fact Recall 
> 1. A dielectric material is an insulating material that is placed between two plates of a capacitor.
> 2. Permittivity is how difficult it is to generate an electric field in a certain medium.
