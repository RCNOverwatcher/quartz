# The Ideal Gas Equation 

> [!Tip] The Gas Law 
> $$pV=nRT$$
> - $p$ is pressure in pascals
> - $V$ is volume 
> - $T$ is temperature in kelvin
> - $n$ is number of moles 
> - $R$ is $8.31JK^{-1}mol^{-1}$ aka the molar gas constant 

> [!Tip] Transforming the Gas Law 
> If the number of particles in the sample of gas is $N$ then as $n\times N_{A}$ so:
> 
> $$pV=NkT$$
> - $p$ is pressure in pascals
> - $V$ is volume 
> - $T$ is temperature in kelvin
> - $N$ is number of particles in the sample of gas (big number)
> - $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($1.38 \times 10^{â€“23}$)

> [!Info] Boltzmann Constant 
> $$k=\frac{R}{N_{A}}$$
> - $k$ is the Boltzmann constant 
> - $R$ is the molar gas constant 
> - $N_{A}$ is the Avogadro constant
