# The Mass-Spring System as a Simple Harmonic Oscillator 

> [!Info] A mass on a string 
> - A mass on a spring is a simple harmonic oscillator (SHO). When the mass is pushed or pulled either side of the equilibrium position, there's a restoring force exerted on it.
> - The size and direction of this restoring force is given by [[Hooke's Law]] 
> $$F=k\Delta L$$
> - For a displacement, $x$, the restoring force becomes $F=-kx$ (negative because the force acts in the opposite direction to displacement)
> - Newton's second law states that the resultant force on an object equals the mass of the object times its acceleration, F = ma. Inserting this into the equation $F = -kx$, and replacing a with the acceleration for an object oscillating with SHM, $a = -\omega^2x = -(2\pi f)^2x$, gives: $-(2\pi f)^2mx=-kx$
> - The $x$'s cancel and we are left with:
>   $f=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{ \frac{k}{m} }$
> - Subbing in $f=\frac{1}{T}$, gives us the period of a mass oscillating on a spring.
> - $T=2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{m}{k} }$

> [!Info] Springs in parallel or series 
> - When you place springs in parallel, they add normally: $k_{\text{total}}=k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}\dots$
> - When springs are placed in series, the spring constants add inversely: $\frac{1}{k_{\text{total}}}=\frac{1}{k_{1}}+\frac{1}{k_{2}}+\frac{1}{k_{3}}\dots$
