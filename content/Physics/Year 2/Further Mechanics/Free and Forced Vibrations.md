# Free and Forced Vibrations

> [!Info] Resonance 
> - You get resonance when the natural frequency is equal to the driving frequency.
> - When the driving frequency approaches the natural frequency, the system gains more and more energy from the driving force and so vibrates with a rapidly increasing amplitude. 
> - When this happens, the system is resonating. 
> - At resonance the phase difference between the driver and oscillator is 900. 

> [!Info] Free Vibrations 
> - Free vibrations involve no transfer of energy to or from the surroundings. 
> - If you stretch and release a mass on a spring, it oscillates at its resonant frequency (or natural frequency). 
> ---
> - The same happens if you strike a metal object — the sound you hear is caused by vibrations at the object's natural frequency. 
> - If no energy's transferred to or from the surroundings, it will keep oscillating with the same amplitude forever. 
> - In practice this never happens, but a spring vibrating in air is called a free vibration anyway.

> [!Info] Forced Vibrations 
> - Forced vibrations happen when there's an external driving force. A system can be forced to vibrate by a periodic external force. 
> - The frequency of this force is called the driving frequency. 
> - If the driving frequency is much less than the natural frequency then the two are in phase. 
> - But if the driving frequency is much greater than the natural frequency, the oscillator won't be able to keep up — you end up with the driver completely out of phase with the oscillator (in antiphase).

> [!Tip] Examples of Resonance 
> - A radio is tuned so the electric circuit resonates at the same frequency as the radio station you want to listen to.
> - A glass resonates when driven by a sound wave at the right frequency.
> - The column of air resonates in an organ pipe, driven by the motion of air at the base. This creates a stationary wave in the pipe.
> - A swing resonates if it's driven by someone pushing it at its natural frequency.

> [!Abstract] The solution: Damping 
> - In practice, any oscillating system loses energy to its surroundings. 
> - This is usually down to frictional forces like air resistance. 
> - These are called damping forces. 
> - Systems are often deliberately damped to stop them oscillating or to minimise the effect of resonance.
> - The degree of damping can vary from light damping (where the damping force is small) to overdamping. 
> - Damping reduces the amplitude of the oscillation over time. 
> - Generally, the heavier the damping, the quicker the amplitude is reduced to zero (although overdamping is an exception).
