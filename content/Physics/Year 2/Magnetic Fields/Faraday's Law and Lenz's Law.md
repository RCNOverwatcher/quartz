# Faraday's Law and Lenz's Law 

> [!Info] Induced EMF in a rotating coil 
> - When a coil such as that in Figure 3 rotates uniformly (at a steady speed) in a magnetic field, the coil cuts the flux and an alternating e.m.f. is induced.

> - The amount of flux cut by the coil (flux linkage) is given by:
> - $N\phi = BAN\cos\theta$. 
> ---
> - As the coil rotates, $\theta$ changes so the flux linkage varies sinusoidally between $+BAN$ and $-BAN$.
> - How fast $\theta$ changes depends on the angular speed $\omega$ of the coil $\theta=\omega t$
> - $N\phi=BAN\cos\omega t$
> ---
> - The induced emf depends on the rate of change of flux linkage (Faraday's Law) so it also varies sinusoidally.
> - The equation for emf at time=$t$ is: $\varepsilon=BAN\omega \sin\omega t$

>  The shape of the graph of induced e.m.f. can be altered by changing the speed of rotation or the size of the magnetic field: 
>  - Increasing the speed of rotation will increase the frequency and increase the maximum e.m.f. 
>  - Increasing the magnetic flux density $B$ will increase the maximum e.m.f., but will have no effect on the frequency.

> [!Info] Summary 
> - AC electricity alternates sinusoidally with a frequency of 50hz and a peak potential difference of 325 volts.
> - An oscilloscope trace can be used to analyse a wave and measure the time period and peak potential difference.
> - The root mean squared of both current and potential difference can be used to calculate the power rating of an AC supply.
