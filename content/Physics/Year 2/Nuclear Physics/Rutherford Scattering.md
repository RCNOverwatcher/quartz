# Rutherford Scattering

> [!Example] Give an account of the evidence that led to Rutherford proposing the nuclear model of the atom.
> Rutherford set up an experiment with alpha emitters firing at a thin sheet of gold leaf, in an evacuated chamber which was covered with a florescent coating. 
> - Most alpha particles passed straight through the foil with no deflection - this suggested that the atom is mostly empty space (and not a uniform density as suggested by the plum pudding model). 
> - A small amount of particles were deflected by a large angle - this suggested that the centre of the atom is positively charged, as positively charged alpha particles were repelled from the centre and deflected. 
> - Very few particles were deflected back by more than 90Â° - this suggested that the that the centre of the atom was very dense as it could deflect fast moving alpha particles, but also that is was very small as a very small amount of particles were deflected by this amount.

2. 
a) Reduce the chance of alpha particles colliding with air molecules.
b) So that the alpha particle could travel through it
3. 
a) Steeper curve 
b) Less steep curve 
c) Steeper curve 
d) Less steep curve
