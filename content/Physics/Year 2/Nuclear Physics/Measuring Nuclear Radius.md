# Measuring Nuclear Radius 

> [!Tip] Coulomb's Law 
> $$\text{Initial } E_{k}=E_{\text{elec}}=\frac{Q_{\text{nucleus}q_{\text{alpha}}}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}r}$$
> - $E_{\text{elec}}$ is electric potential energy 
> - $\varepsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space
> - $Q_{\text{nucleus}}$ is the charge on the nucleus
> - $q_{\text{alpha}}$ is the charge on the alpha particle 
> - $r$ is how close the particle can get to the nucleus 

> [!Tip] Electron Diffraction 
> $$\lambda \approx \frac{hc}{E}$$
> - $\lambda$ is the de broglie wavelength
> - $h$ is the plank constant 
> - $c$ is the speed of light
> - $E$ is the energy of the electron

> [!Tip] First Minimum
> $$\sin\theta \approx \frac{1.22\lambda}{2R}$$
> - $\theta$ is the scattering angle 
> - $\lambda$ is the wavelength 
> - $R$ is the radius of the nucleus that the electrons have been scattered by
