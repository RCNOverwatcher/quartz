# Weak Interaction

## Beta-minus Decay

> [!Info] Beta-minus Decay
> - In $\beta^-$ decay, a neutron is turned into a proton.
> - This means that the *udd* structure of a neutron turns into a uud structure for a proton.
> - This involves turning a d quark into a u quark (also known as changing a quark's character)
> - Only the weak interaction can do this

## Beta-plus Decay

> [!Info] Beta-plus Decay
> - Some unstable isotopes, like Carbon-11, decay by $\beta^+$ emission.
> - $\beta^+$ decay means a positron is emitted.
> - In this case, a proton changes into a neutron.
> - So a u quark changes into a d quark.
