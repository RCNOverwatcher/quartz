# Inside the Atom

## Structure of an Atom

> [!Info] Structure
> - Atoms are made up of protons, neutrons and electrons.
> - At the centre of every atom, there is a nucleus which contains a certain combination of protons and neutrons
>- Protons and neutrons are both known as [[Nucleon Number|Nucleons]]
>- Orbiting the nucleus are electrons
>- Most of the atom is empty space

## Charges and Masses

> [!info] Charges of particles inside atoms
> 
> | Particle | Charge (C)   | Mass (kg)   |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Proton   | +1.60x10^-19 | 1.67x10^-27 |
| Neutron  | 0            | 1.67x10^-27 |
| Electron | -1.60x10^-19 | 9.11x10^-31 |
