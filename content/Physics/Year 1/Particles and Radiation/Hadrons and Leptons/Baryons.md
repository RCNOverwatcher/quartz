# Baryons


### **BARYONS ARE A TYPE OF HADRON**

> [!Info] Baryons
> - Include protons, neutrons and sigma
> - Made of three quarks
> - Baryons have anti-particles
> - All baryons have a baryon number, which is a quantum number and must be conserved.

>[!Info] Baryon Numbers
>- Baryons or normal matter have a baryon nyumber of +1
>- Baryons of antimatter have a baryon number of -1
>- Non-baryons have a baryon number of 0
>- Baryon number can be written as "B"

> [!Info] Stability
> - Almost all baryons are unstable and will decay over time. The only non-decaying baryon is the proton.
> - Neutrons decay via beta decay $$n \to p+e^-+(anti){v_{e}}$$
> - During a decay, the baryon number is always conserved, as shown in the equation above. $(+1 \to +1 + 0 + 0)$
