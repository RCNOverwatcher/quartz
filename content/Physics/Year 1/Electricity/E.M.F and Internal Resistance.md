# E.M.F and Internal Resistance

> [!Info] Internal resistance
> - Resistance comes from electrons colliding with atoms and losing energy.
> - In a battery, chemical energy is used to make electrons move. As they move, they collide with atoms inside the battery â€” so batteries must have resistance.
> - This is called internal resistance. Internal resistance is what makes batteries and cells warm up when they're used.

> - $\varepsilon=V+\text{lost volts}$
> - $\varepsilon=V+Ir$ (ohms law)
> - $\varepsilon=Ir+IR$
> - $\varepsilon=I(R+r)$
> - $V=\varepsilon-Ir$


> [!Info] EMF
> - The amount of electrical energy the battery produces and transfers to each coulomb of charge is called its electromotive force or e.m.f. (e). 
> - Be careful, e.m.f. isn't actually a force. It's measured in volts.

> - The potential difference (p.d.) across the load resistance (R) is the energy transferred when one coulomb of charge flows through the load resistance. 
> - This potential difference is called the terminal p.d. (V). 
> - If there was no internal resistance, the terminal p.d. would be the same as the e.m.f.
> - However, in real power supplies, there's always some energy lost overcoming the internal resistance. 
> - The energy wasted per coulomb overcoming the internal resistance is called the lost volts (v).

> [!Info] Using a straight line equation for Internal Resistance 
> - $\varepsilon=V+Ir$ can be rearranged into$V=-rI+\varepsilon$.
> - This is in the same format as $y=mx+c$ which means we can use it in a straight line equation.
> - $V$ is on the y-axis, $I/A$ is on the x-axis, $r$ is the gradient, and $\varepsilon$ is the y-intercept.
