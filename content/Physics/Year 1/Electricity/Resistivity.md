# Resistivity

> [!Info] Resistivity definition
> - Resistivity is how resistant a material is and how well current can go through it.
> - It is the opposite of conductivity.
> ![[Pasted image 20230120113623.png|500]]
> - When you double the length, the resistivity doubles because it has twice as much distance to get through.
> - When you double the area, the resistivity halves because it is twice as easy to get through (imagine a road going from one lane to two lanes.)
