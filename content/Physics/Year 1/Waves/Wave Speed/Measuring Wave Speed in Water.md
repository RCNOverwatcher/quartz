# Measuring Wave Speed in Water

> [!Info] Wave speed in water
> - You can measure the speed of waves through water using a ripple tank
>  ![[Pasted image 20221107120310.png|500]]
> - Start by recording the depth of the water in metres
> - Use the ripple tank dipper to create water waves with a normal frequency
> - Dim the main lights and put on a strobe light.
> - Increase the freqency of the strobe light until the waves appear to the standing still. (strobe light frequency = water wave frequency)
> - Use a ruler on the white paper below the ripple tank to measure the distance between two adjacent peaks.
> - Use the wave equation to calculate the speed of the waves
> - Repeat this experiment for a variety of water depths
> - Waves should travel more quickly in deeper water.
