# Calculating Wave Speed

> [!Info] How to calculate wave speed
> $$c=\frac{d}{t}$$
> - $c$ is the wave speed in $ms^{-1}$
> - $d$ is the distance in m
> - $t$ is the time in seconds

> [!Info] Another wave speed formula
> $$c=f\lambda$$
> - $c$ is the wave speed in $ms^{-1}$
> - $\lambda$ is the wavelength in m
> - $f$ is the frequency in Hz
