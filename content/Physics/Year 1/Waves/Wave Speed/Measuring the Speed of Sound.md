> [!Info] Measuring the Speed of Sound
> - To measure the speed of sound, you can set up an experiment with two microphones.

>  - Use the signal generator to produce a sound from the loudspeaker and use the computer to measure the time taken between the first microphone detecting the sound and the second microphone detecting the sound.
