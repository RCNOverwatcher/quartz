# Evidence of the Wave Nature of Light



>[!Info]  The two theories
> Towards the end of the 17th century, Newton and Huygens had a debate.
> Newton said that light was a particle, whereas Huygens said that light was a wave
> The particle theory could explain relection and refraction, but not diffraction and interference, because those properties are specific to waves.

>[!Info] 100 years later...
>100 years later, Young came up with his double slit experiment to explain light interference, which had not been proven beforehand. 
>It showed that it could diffract through the narrow slits, and interfere to form the interference pattern on the screen at the end.
