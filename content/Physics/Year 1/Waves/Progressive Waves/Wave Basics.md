# Wave Basics
 
> [!Info] Progressive waves
> - Progressive waves transfer energy from one place to another without transfering any material.
> - A wave is caused by making particles oscillate at a source.
> - E.G. EM waves cause things to heat up, loud sounds can cause air to vibrate/oscillate.
> - Waves can be reflected, refracted and diffracted.

> [!Info] Measurments of waves
> - Displacement: x, measured in metres. (how far a point on a wave has moved from it's undisturbed position)
> - Amplitude: A, measured in metres. (distanced to the top of the wave's peak from the undisturbed position)
> - Wavelength: $\lambda$, measured in metres. (difference between two crests on a wave)
> - Period: T, measured in seconds. (time it takes for a wavelength to occur)
> - Frequency: f, measured in Hz (number of wave peaks/troughs per second)
> - Phase (measurment of a specific point on a wave as it travels) (measured in degrees or radians)
> - Phase difference (the amount of how far one wave lags behind another) (measured in degrees or radians)
