# Critical Angle and TIR

> [!Info] Glass to Air and Air to Glass
> - If you use Snell's Law to get the reflective index of Glass to Air, then the reflective index of Air to Glass will be the reciprocal of the former.

>[!Tip] The equation for critical angle
>$$\sin\theta_{c}=\frac{n^2}{n^1}$$
>$$n_{1}\sin\theta_{1}=n_{2}\sin\theta_{2}$$

> [!Info] TIR = Total Internal Reflection
