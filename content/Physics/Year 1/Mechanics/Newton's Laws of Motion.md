# Newton's Laws of Motion

> [!Tip]- Newtons First Law 
> - If a space man is out in space in a vaccuum, he will continue to move in the same direction unless acted on by a resultant force.
> - This is because of Newton's First Law:
> 		   **An object will remain at rest or continue to move with a constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force.**

> [!Tip]- Newtons Second Law 
> $$F=ma$$
> - **The net force acting on an object is directly propotional to the rate of change of momentum and is in the same direction.**

> [!Tip]- Newtons Third Law 
> - **When two objects interact, they will exert equal and opposite forces on each other. The forces have to be of the same type.**
> - E.G. Two electrons are next to each other. The electromagnetic force on each electron exerts itself on the other electron which pushes them both away from each other. This is why we get a normal contact force.
