# What is the Photoelectric effect?

> [!Tip] Important equations for this topic
> $e=hf$
> $hf=\phi+E_{k (max)}$

> [!Info] The Photoelectric Effect
> - If you shine radiation of a high enough frequency onto the surface of a metal, then it will instantly emit electrons called **photoelectrons**. This frequency required is usually in the ultraviolet wavelength.
> - This is not cumulative.

> [!Info] The 4 conclusions
> 1. No matter how much radiation you fire, you will never get an electron if the frequency is not high enough.
> 2. The photoelectrons are emitted with various kinetic energies. Some have 0 kinetic energy, and some have the maximum kinetic energy.
> 3. The intensity of the radiation is the amount of energy hitting an area of the metal per second. The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is **unaffected** by varying the intensity of the radiation.
> 4. The **number** of photoelectrons emitted per second is proportional to the intensity of the radiation.

> [!Info] Summary
> - The Photoelectric Effect is the phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from the surface of a metal when it is exposed to light. 
> - This effect is only observed when the frequency of the light is above a certain threshold, known as the threshold frequency. 
>-  The kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is directly proportional to the frequency of the light, and is independent of the intensity of the light. 
> - The Photoelectric Effect is important because it was the first experimental evidence to support the idea that light can behave as both a wave and a particle, known as the wave-particle duality.
