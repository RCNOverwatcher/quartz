# Line Emmission Spectra

> [!Info] Line Emmission Spectra
> - You can split light using a prism or a diffraction grating.
> - This gives a line spectrum.
> - A line emmission spectrum displays lots of bright lines against a black background.
> - Each line corresponds to a different wavelength (therefore different energy in the photon)

>- Line spectrums give us evidence that electrons exist in discrete energy levels.
