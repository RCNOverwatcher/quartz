# Electron Transitions

> [!Example]- Calculate the wavelength of the photon released when an electron drops from energy level 3 to energy level 2

> - $3.4-1.5=1.9eV$
> - $eV \to J$ = $1.60\times 10^{-19}$
> - $1.90$ $eV$ $\to$ $3.04\times 10^{-19}J$
> 
> - Use the equation $E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$
> - Rearrange to: $\lambda=\frac{hc}{E}$
> - $\frac{(6.63\times10^{-34})\times(3.00\times 10^8)}{3.04\times 10^{-19}}=6.54\times10^{-7}$

> [!Info] Electron Transitions using Line Emission Spectrums
> - When an electron jumps down an energy level, a photon is released.
> - This photon has a wavelength that depends on how much energy is in it (how much energy was released from the electron)
> > [!Tip] The equations
> > - $$E=hf$$
> > - $$E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
> > - $$\lambda=\frac{hc}{E}$$
> - These equations can be used to calculate energy, wavelength and freqency.

> [!Info] Ionisation
> - When an electron is removed from an atom, the atom is ionised.
> - The energy of each energy level shows the amount of energy required to remove an electron from that particular energy level.
> - The **Ionisation energy** shows how much energy is required to remove an electron from the ground state.
