# Quantum Exam Style Questions

> [!Example] Question 1
>a)  The work function of a metal is the amount of energy required to have photoelectrons emitted from the surface of the metal.
>b) When an electron is hit by a photon that is under the threshold frequency, the electron does not gain enough energy to be emitted as a photoelectron. This means the electron is emmitted again and no change occurs.
>c) The threshold frequency shows that light acts as a particle. If light acted as a wave, then energy would build up over time and all of the photoelectrons would be emitted from the metal. However, this doesnt happen, therefore proving light is made of photons.
>d) $6.8\times 10^{-19}$
>e) $3.0\times10^{-18}-6.8\times 10^{-19}=2.32\times 10^{-18}$
>f) Stopping potential = $\frac{E_{k(max)}}{\text{electron charge}}$
>$\frac{2.32\times 10^{-18}}{1.6\times10^{-19}}=14.5=14$
