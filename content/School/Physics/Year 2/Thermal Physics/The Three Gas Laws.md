# The Three Gas Laws 

> [!Tip] The Three Laws 
> - Boyle's Law 
> - Charles' Law 
> - The Pressure Law 

> [!Info] Boyle's Law 
> $$pV=k$$
> When temperature is constant, pressure and volume are inversely proportional

> [!Info] Charles' Law
> $$\frac{V}{T}=k$$
> When pressure is constant, volume is directly proportional to absolute temperature

> [!Info] The Pressure Law
> $$\frac{p}{T}=k$$
> When volume is constant, pressure is directly proportional to absolute temperature

> [!Tip] Combining the Gas Laws 
> $$\frac{p_{1}v_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{p_{2}v_{2}}{T_{2}}$$
