# Kinetic Theory and the Pressure of an Ideal Gas 

> [!Info] Deriving the ideal pressure of a gas 
> 1.  First, you must consider a cube with side lengths $l$, full of gas molecules. One of these molecules, has a mass $m$ and is travelling towards the right-most wall of the container, with a velocity $v$. Assuming it collides with this wall elastically, its change in momentum is $mv-(-mv)=2mv$
> 2.  Before this molecule can collide with this wall again it must travel a distance of $2l$. Therefore the time between collisions is $t$, where $t=\frac{2l}{v}$
> 3. Using these two bits of information we can find the impulse, which is the rate of change of momentum of the molecule. As impulse is equal to the force exerted, we can find pressure by dividing our value of impulse by the area of one wall: $F=\frac{2mv}{\frac{2l}{u}}=\frac{mv^2}{l}$
> 4. Find pressure = force over area, where area is $l^2$: $P=\frac{mv^2}{\frac{l}{l^2}}=\frac{mv^2}{l^3}=\frac{mv^2}{V}$
