# Energy Stored by Capacitors

> [!Abstract] Equations 
> - You can use $Q=CV$ to eliminate Q and V separately from the equation: $W=\frac{1}{2}QV$ to get:
> 	- $W=\frac{1}{2}CV^2$
> 	- $W=\frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^2}{C}$

> [!Example] A 0.10 F capacitor is connected to a power supply and then removed. The energy stored in the capacitor is 25J. Calculate the initial p.d. across the capacitor.
> - $W=25J$
> - $C=0.10F$
> - $W=\frac{1}{2}CV^2$
> - $25=\frac{1}{2}\times0.1\times V^2$
> - $V=22V$ to 2sf
