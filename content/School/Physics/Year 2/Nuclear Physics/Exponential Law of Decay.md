# Exponential Law of Decay 

> [!Info] The rate of radioactive decay 
> - Radioactive decay is completely random — you can't predict which atom's nucleus will decay when. 
> - But although you can't predict the decay of an individual nucleus, if you take a very large number of nuclei, their overall behaviour shows a pattern. 
> - Isotopes of an element have the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei. 
> - Any sample of a particular isotope has the same rate of decay — i.e. the same proportion of atomic nuclei will decay in a given time. 
> - Each unstable nucleus within the isotope will also have a constant decay probability.

> [!Tip] The Decay Constant and Activity 
> $$A=\lambda N$$
> - where $A$ is the activity in Becquerels
> - where $\lambda$ is the decay constant in $s^{-1}$
> - where $N$ is the number of unstable nuclei in the sample

> Also can be written as:

> $$A=-\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t}$$

> Combining these equations:
> $$\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t}=-\lambda N$$
> - where $\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t}$ is the rate of change of unstable nuclei 
> - where $\lambda$ is the decay constant in $s^{-1}$
> - where $N$ is the number of unstable nuclei in the sample

> [!Tip] The Decay Equation 
> $$N=N_{0}e^{-\lambda t}$$
> - where $N$ is the number of unstable nuclei remaining 
> - where $N_{0}$ is the original amount of unstable nuclei 
> - where $\lambda$ is the decay constant 
> - and where $t$ is time in seconds 

> [!Info] If asked about molar mass...
> $$N=nN_{A}$$
> - $N$ is the number of atoms in a sample 
> - $n$ is the number of moles in the sample 
> - $N_{A}$ is Avogadro's Constant
