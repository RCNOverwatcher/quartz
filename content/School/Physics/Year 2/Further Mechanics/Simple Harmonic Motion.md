# Simple Harmonic Motion 

> [!Info] What is SHM (Simple Harmonic Motion)
> - An object moving with SHM oscillates to and fro, either side of an equilibrium position.
> - This equilibrium position is the midpoint of the objects motion.
> - This distance of the object from the equilibrium is called the displacement.
> ---
> - There is always a restoring force pulling or pushing the object back towards its equilibrium position.
> - The size of the restoring force depends on the displacement.
> - The restoring force makes the object accelerate towards the equilibrium.

> [!Tip] Definition of SHM 
> - An oscillation in which the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position and directed towards the equilibrium. 
> - $$\mathbf{a} \propto -\mathbf{x}$$

> [!Info] SHM on a graph 
> - Displacement is measured as a sine or cosine wave. It has a maximum value of A.
> - Velocity is the gradient/derivate of the displacement graph. It has a maximum value of $\omega A$
> - Acceleration is the 2nd derivate of the displacement graph. It has a maximum value of $\omega^2A$

> [!Example]- A 50kg mass on the end of a spring is undergoing SHM. The potential energy of the mass is 28J at the maximum displacement. Calculate the maximum velocity that the mass reaches while oscillating. 
> - $28=\frac{1}{2}\times50\times v^2$
> - $28=25\times v^2$
> - $\sqrt{ \frac{28}{25} }$
> - $1.058$
> - $1.1$ to 2 

> [!Example]- A girl with a mass of 35 kg is sitting on a swing, which is undergoing simple harmonic motion. To start the motion, she raised the swing 0.40 m above its lowest position, then lifted her feet off the round.
> a) Find the maximum velocity the girl reaches on the swing.
> - $\frac{1}{2}mv^2=mgh$
> - $mgh=35\times9.81\times 0.40=137.34$
> - $\frac{1}{2}mv^2=137.34$
> - $mv^2=274.68$
> - $v=2.8014$
> - $=2.8$ to 2 s.f
> ---
> b) Sketch a graph of the girl's kinetic energy against time for one complete oscillation of the swing.

> [!Example]- A pendulum is undergoing simple harmonic motion. The maximum displacement of the pendulum is 0.60 m and the maximum velocity of the pendulum is 0.90 ms$^{-1}$.
> a) Frequency?
> - $2\pi fA=0.9$
> - $A=0.6$
> - $2\pi f=1.5$
> - $f=\frac{1.5}{2\pi}=0.24Hz$
> ---
>b) Time taken to complete one cycle: Time period 
> - $T=\frac{1}{f}$
> - $\frac{1}{0.239}=4.189$ seconds 
>---
>c) Maximum acceleration = $\omega^2A$
> $(2\pi f)^2A$
> $(2\times \pi \times 0.239)^2\times 0.6=1.353$ ms$^{-1}$
