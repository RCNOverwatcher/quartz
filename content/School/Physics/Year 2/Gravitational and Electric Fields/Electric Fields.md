# Electric Fields 

> [!Tip] Equations
> $$F=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{r^2}$$
> $$E=\frac{\Delta V}{d}$$
> $$F=EQ$$
> $$E=\frac{F}{Q}$$
> $$W=\Delta VQ$$


> [!Tip] Proportionality
> $$E \propto V$$
> $$E\propto\frac{1}{d}$$
> $$F\propto E$$
> $$F\propto Q$$

> [!Example] Two electrons are fired towards each other and reach a separation of 5.22 x 10^-13 m. What's the force on each electron at this point?
> $$\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\times \frac{(-1.6\times10^{-19})^2}{(5.22\times10^{-13})^2}=8.44\times10^{-4}$$

> [!Example] The electric field generated by a charged sphere with charge 4.15 microcoulombs is measured as 15 000 NC^-1. How far from the centre of the sphere must the measuring instrument be?
> $$\sqrt{ \frac{1}{4\pi \times E} \times \frac{4.15\times10^{-6}}{15000}}=1.57=1.6$$
