# Gravitational Potential 

> [!Abstract] Definitions
> - Gravitational potential energy is defined y the amount of work required to move a mass from infinity to a point in the gravitational field.
> - We often talk about the change in gravitational energy and use the delta sign ($\Delta$) to signify change.
> - This definition does not include "per unit mass" which is what separates it from gravitational potential, and makes it energy.

> [!Tip] Equation for Gravitational Potential 
> $$V=-\frac{GM}{r}$$

> [!Info] Gravitational Potential
> - If I have a unit mass, which is at a point in a gravitational field with a value of -20MJ kg$^{-1}$
> - This means it would take 20MJ of energy to move it to infinity.

> [!Example]- The radius of the earth is 6370km and it has a mass of $5.97\times10^{24}$. Calculate the gravitational potential on the surface of the earth.
> - $$\frac{-6.67\times10^{-11})\times(5.97\times10^{24}}{6370000}=-62511616.95$$
> - $$-62511616.95\div 1000000=-62.5MJ$$

> [!Example]- The mass of the earth is $5.97\times10^{24}$ and it has a radius of $6370$km. Calculate the GPE of a 75kg satellite at a height of 1200km.
> - $\frac{(-6.67\times10^{-11})\times(5.97\times10^{24})\times(75)}{(6370+1200)\times10^3}=-3945168428$
> - $-3945168428=-3.95\times10^9J$ or $-3.95\text{ GJ}$
