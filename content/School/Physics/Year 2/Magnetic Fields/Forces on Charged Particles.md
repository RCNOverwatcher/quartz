# Forces on Charged Particles 

> [!Info] Charged Particles in a magnetic field 
> - A force acts on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field. 
> - This is why a current-carrying wire experiences a force in a magnetic field â€” electric current in a wire is the flow of negatively charged electrons.
> - The force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field perpendicular to the current is given by F = BIL
> - Electric current, I, is the flow of charge, Q, per unit time, t. So $I=\frac{Q}{t}$
> - A charged particle which moves a distance I in time t has a velocity, $v = \frac{l}{t}$, so $l=vt$
> - Putting all these equations together gives the force acting on a single charged particle moving through a magnetic field, where its velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field:
>   ---
> $$F=BQv$$
> - Where:
> 	- $F$ = force 
> 	- $B$ = Magnetic Field Strength 
> 	- $Q$ = Charge
> 	- $v$ = Velocity (in $m/s$)

> - As a particle movies through a magnetic field, it is unlikely to be moving perpendicular to the field lines. If it's velocity vector is at an angle $\theta$ to the field lines, then the formula becomes:
>   $$F=BQv\sin(\theta)$$

> [!Info] Motor force acting on particles 
> - The motor force acts on individual particles in exactly the same way as it does on a current carrying wire, this is because it is the eletrons in the wire that feel the force. 
> - This effect is used in particle accelerators to both steer the particles around the circular path and also to analyse the new particles created as find out their properties.

## The circular path of particles 

>[!Info] Three simple rules 
>- The motor force is always perpendicular to the velocity vector of the particle so no work is done.
>- Flemming's left hand rule shows that the motor force is continually perpendicular to the motion of the particle so the particle will trace out a circular path.
>- The force causes an acceleration but not a change in speed so it is a centripetal force.
