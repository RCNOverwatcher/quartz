# Magnetic Flux Density

> [!Tip] Equations 
> - $$F=BIl$$
> - $$F=BIl\sin\theta$$
> - $$F=BIln$$
> 
> Where:
> - $F$ is force in newtons 
> - $B$ is magnetic flux density in tesla 
> - $I$ is current in amperes
> - $l$ is length in metres 
> - $n$ is the number of coils if a wire is coiled inside a magnetic field

> [!Abstract] Magnetic Flux Density Units 
> $$T=\frac{N}{Am}$$
> one tesla = one newton per amp per metre
