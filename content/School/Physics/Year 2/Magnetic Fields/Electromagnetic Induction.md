> [!Info] EM Induction 
> - Electromagnetic Induction means that an emf (electromagnetic flux) is created when a wire is passed through a magnetic field. 
> - If the wire is part of a complete circuit, then the emf will create a current flow in the wire.
> - The emf can be increased by using a stronger magnet, a coil of wire or moving the wire faster. (also make sure perpendicular to magnetic field)

> [!Info] Using a dynamo
> - A dynamo contains a magnet that spins within a coil of wire. 
> - This induces an emf in the coil which in turn can produce a current.

> [!Info] Lenz's Law 
> - When you push a magnet into a coil of wire, it creates a current in the wire.
> - The current in turn creates a magnetic field (the coil becomes a solenoid)

> [!Info] Magnetic Flux
> Magnetic Flux Density (B) can be thought of as the strength of a magnetic field 
> If you multiply this by a known area (A) of a field then you get the **Magnetic Flux $\Phi$**

> [!Tip] Calculating emf
> $$\varepsilon=\frac{W}{Q}=\frac{BIl\Delta s}{I \Delta t}=\frac{Bl\Delta s}{\Delta t}=\frac{BA}{\Delta t}=\frac{\Phi}{\Delta t}$$

> [!Tip] Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction 
> "The induced emf in a circuit is equal to the rate of change of flux linkage throughout the circuit."
> $$\varepsilon=-N\frac{\Delta\phi}{\Delta t}$$
