# Optical Fibres

> [!Info] Optical Fibers
> - An optical fibre is a long flexible piece of glass that is used to carry light over long distances and round corners.
> - An optical fibre consists of cladding and core. The core has a higher refractive index and the cladding has a lower refractive index. This means that the light stays within the optical fibre and doesnt escape. 
> - The optical fibre cladding also protects the fibre from scratches that could damage it.
