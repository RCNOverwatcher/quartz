# The Double Slit Formula

> [!Formula] The formula
> $$W = \frac{\lambda D}{s}$$
> 	- W = fringe spacing, the distance between two adjacent minima or maxima in metres
> 	- $\lambda$ = wavelength in metres
> 	- D = distance between the slits and the screen in metres
> 	- s = the distance between the slits on metres
> 	
> 	Do **not** need to remember this formula (given)
