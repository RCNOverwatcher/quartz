# Work and Power

---
### Basics

> [!Tip] Work done 
> $$W=Fx$$
> (Work = Force $\times$ distance travelled)
> (Joules are measured in Newton Metres $Nm^{-1}$)

> [!Example]- What is the work done when pushing a box weighing 40N over a distance of 2m?
> - $W=Fx$
> - $40N\times2m=80J$

> [!Example]- What is the work done when a phone weighing 150g falls 1m.
> - $W=Fx$
> - $F=0.15N$
> - $1.5N\times 1m=1.5J$

> [!Example]- An object is being moved up a smooth slope up to a height of 0.5m. The weight of the ball is 8N. How much work is done?
> - Since work is only done against the direction of gravity, the same work is done no matter the distance it took to get there.
> - $W=Fx$
> - $8\times 0.5=4J$

### Angles

> [!Info] Work done at an angle to motion 
> - Some questions will involve a force that is at an angle to the direction of travel.
> - In this case we resolve the force with the angle to the dirction of motion.
> - If something is moving horizontally then we can use $W=F x\times \cos\theta$

### Power

> [!Tip] Equation for Power 
> $$P=Fv$$ 
> $$P=\frac{W}{t}$$
> $$P=\frac{Fs}{t}$$

> [!Tip] Equation for power at an angle 
> $$P=Fv\times \cos\theta$$
