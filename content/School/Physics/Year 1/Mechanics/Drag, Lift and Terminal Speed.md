# Drag, Lift and Terminal Speed

> [!Tip] Drag in relation to velocity 
> $$D\propto v^2$$

> [!Info] What 3 things affect drag?
> 1. Surface area 
> 2. Velocity 
> 3. Density of the fluid you are going though

> [!Example]- A skydiver is falling towards the earth at a terminal velocity of $45ms^{-1}$. Describe what she could do to change her terminal velocity.
> - The skydiver could increase her surface area by spreading her arms out. This would increase the air resistance on her and increase the drag force overall.

> [!Example]- A rubber ball of mass 0.120kg is dropped from a tall building. Calculate the magnitude of the drag force as it falls through the air at it's terminal velocity.
> - $F=ma$
> - $F=0.120 \times 9.81=1.1772N$ of force going downwards.
> - At terminal velocity, the upwards force = the downwards force, therefore the drag = $1.1772N$.

> [!Example]- At $10ms^{-1}$, the drag force acting on a car is 1.0kN. What is the drag force acting on the same car travelling at $30ms^{-1}$?
> - $9.0kN$

> [!Example]- Determine the instantaneous acceleration of each object.
> 1. Skydiver with 800N downwards and 300N upwards.
>	- $F=ma$
>	- $\frac{800}{9.81}=81.5kg$
