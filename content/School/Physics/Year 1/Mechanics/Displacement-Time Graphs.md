# Displacement-Time Graphs

> [!Info] Rules for Displacement-Time Graphs
> - Gradient is velocity 
> - Measures distance from starting point 
> - If the gradient is increasing, acceleration is happening.
> - If the gradient is decreasing, decceleration is happening.
> - Flat line means no velocity.
