 > [!Info] Free body diagrams
 > - Free body diagrams show an object with all of the forces it is experiencing drawn as force arrows.

> [!Info] How to resolve forces on a force board 
> - First resolve your individual forces using $F_{\text{vertical}} =F\times \sin\theta$ and $F_{\text{horizontal}}=F\times \sin\theta$
> - Then add your vertical componants together to find the weight required (this question only)
