# Projectile Motion

## Projectiles

> [!Info] Projectile Motion 
> - Any object given an initial velocity and then left to move freely under gravity is a projectile. In projectile motion, the horizontal and vertical components of the object's motion are completely independent. 
> - Projectiles follow a curved path because the horizontal velocity remains constant, while the vertical velocity is affected by the acceleration due to gravity, $g$.
> ---
> - If something's projected at an angle (like, say, a javelin) you start off with both horizontal and vertical velocity. This can make solving problems trickier. 
> - To solve this kind of problem, you need to use this method: Resolve the initial velocity into horizontal and vertical components. 
> - Use the vertical component to work out how long it's in the air and/or how high it goes. 
> - Use the horizontal component to work out how far it goes in the horizontal direction while it's in the air.

> [!Info] Projectile motion and air resistance 
> - Air resistance (see page 1 45) causes a drag force that acts in the opposite direction to motion and affects the trajectory of a projectile. 
> - The horizontal component of drag reduces the horizontal speed of the projectile, and reduces the horizontal distance the projectile can travel. 
> - If the projectile has a vertical component of velocity, drag reduces the maximum height the projectile will reach, and steepens the angle of descent.

> [!Example]- A gun fires a bullet at $502\text{ }ms^{-1}$ horizontally. If the gun washeld $1.61 m$ above the ground, how far will the bullet travel? Assume there's no air resistance and the ground is horizontal.
> $s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$
> $s=\frac{1}{2}gt^2$
> $-1.61=\frac{1}{2}-9.81\times t^2$
> $=0.5729$ seconds 
> 
> $502\times 0.5729=287.6m$

> [!Example]- A golf ball is hit at 12.1 ms$^{-1}$ at an angle of 31.50$^\circ$ above the horizontal from a podium 4.20 m above the surface of the ground. Calculate the maximum height above the ground reached by the ball. Assume there's no air resistance and the ground is horizontal.
> - $u=\sin(31.5)\times12.1=6.322$
> - $v^2=u^2+2as$
> - $s=\frac{v^2-u^2}{2a}$
> - $s=\frac{-6.322^2}{2\times 9.81}=2.04$
> - $4.20+2.04=6.24m$

> [!Example]- Questions 
> 1. Projectile Motion.
> 2. Resolve the motion first: horizontal and vertical.
> 3. Drag force is created that slows the projectile down.

## Independent Motion

> [!Example]- A cannonball is fired horizontally from a clifftop at 76.6m above the sea. The initial velocity is $287ms^{-1}$ Calculate the time of flight and the horizontal distance travelled.
> Vertical:
> - $s_{v}:-76.6$
> - $u_{V}:$
> - $v_{v}:$
> - $a_{v}:-9.81$
> - $t:$
> $s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$
> $-76.6= 0+\frac{1}{2}\times 9.81 \times t^2$
> $\sqrt{ \frac{2s}{a} }$
> $t=\sqrt{ \frac{2\times -76.6}{-9.81} }=3.952$ seconds.
> 
> Horizontal:
> - $s_{h}:$
> - $u_{h}:287$
> - $v_{h}:287$
> - $a_{h}:$
> - $t:3.952$ (from previous step)
> - $s_{h}=v_{h}t$
> - $287\times 3.952=1134.166$ metres.
> - $=1130$ metres.

> [!Tip] Componants of Velocity
> - Velocity at **ANY** point is $v=\sqrt{ {v_{x}}^2 +{v_{y}}^2}$
> - At the highest point on the curve of the projectile, the only component is the vertical componant, this means the overall velocity will be slower at the peak of the curve.
> - Throughout the journey of the projectile, the velocity at the end is the same as the velocity at the start.
> - The angle of the projectile from the horizontal is $\theta=\tan^{-1}\frac{v_{y}}{v_{x}}$
> - On the downwards journey, you still measure the angle from the horizontal, but the angle is measured counter clockwise.

> [!Example]- Measuring the Final Velocity 
> Vertical:
> - $s_{v}:-35.1$
> - $u_{V}:0$
> - $v_{v}:?$
> - $a_{v}:-9.81$
> - $t:?$
> 
> Horizontal:
> - $s_{h}:?$
> - $u_{h}:55.2$
> - $v_{h}:55.2$
> - $a_{h}:0$
> - $t:?$
> 
> $v^2=u^2+2as$
> $v^2=0^2+2\times -9.81 \times -35.1$
> $v=26.24$
> 
> Final Velocity:
> - $v=\sqrt{ {v_{x}}^2 +{v_{y}}^2}$
> - $v=\sqrt{ 55.2^2+26.24^2 }=61.1ms^{-1}$
>   
>   Final Angle:
>  - $\theta=\tan^{-1}\left( \frac{26.24}{55.2} \right)=25.4^\circ$
