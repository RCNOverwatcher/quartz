# Electron Diffraction

> [!Info] Electron Diffraction
> - The gap between atoms in Carbon is just the right width for electrons to diffract.
> - This means we can use allotropes of carbon such as graphene or graphite to diffract electrons.

> [!Info] The practical
> - A current goes through a filament causing thermionic emmission of electrons.
> - Those electrons are accellerated through a **<u>high</u>** potential difference into graphite (or another carbon allatrope) which acts as a diffraction grating.
> - Emmission shown by electrons passing energy to excite electrons in flourecent paint at end of the evacuated chamber.
> - The excited electrons drop energy levels and emit photons with energies equaivilent to energy change in drops.

> - This is similar to the [[Diffraction Gratings]] in the waves topic.
