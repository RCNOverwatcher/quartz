# Wave Particle Duality Theory


> [!Tip] The De Broglie Equation
> - $$\lambda=\frac{h}{p}$$
>   Where  $\lambda$  is the wavelength,  $h$  is plank's constant, and  $p$  is the momentum of the electron.
>   
> - $$\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}$$
>  Where  $\lambda$  is the wavelength,  $h$  is plank's constant,  $m$  is the mass of the electron and  $v$  is the velocity.

> [!Info] Summary
>-  Wave-particle duality is the concept in physics that describes the behavior of particles and waves, and the relationship between them. 
> - It states that all particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, depending on the circumstances. 
>-  This duality arises from the fact that the equations of quantum mechanics, which describe the behavior of particles on a very small scale, contain both wave-like and particle-like terms. 
> - The concept of wave-particle duality has been confirmed experimentally through observations such as the double-slit experiment and the Photoelectric Effect. 
> - It is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics and is important for understanding the behavior of subatomic particles.
