# Explaining the Photoelectric Effect

> [!Info] Work function and threshold frequency
> - When EM radiation hits a metal, the metal's surface is bombarded with photons.
> - If one of these photons collides with a free electron, the electron gains this energy ($E=hf$)
> - Before an electron can leave the surface of the metal, it needs enough energy to break the bonds it is being contained by.
> - This is called the Work Function energy ($\phi$).
> ###  
> - If the energy gained by the electron by the photon is greater or equal to the work function energy, then the electron can be emmitted.
> - If the energy gained is less than the work function energy, the electron will shake around a bit but NOT be emitted. Because $hf\geq \phi$ for electrons to be released, the threshold frequency must be $f_{o}=\frac{\phi}{h}$

> [!Info] Maximum kinetic energy
> - The energy transferred from EM radiation to an electron is the energy it absorbs fromone photon $hf$.
> - The minimum amount of energy an electron can lose is the work function energy therefore the max kinetic energy $E_{k(max)}$
>- This means that $E_{k(max)}=hf-\phi$ which can be rearranged in $hf=\phi+E_{k(max)}$
