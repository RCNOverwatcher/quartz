# Quarks

> [!Info] Hadrons and Quarks
> - Protons and neutrons are made up of quarks. 
> - These hadrons experience the strong nuclear force, keeping the nucleons within the nucleus.
> - This force means that the quarks that make up the hadrons cannot be seperated into individual quarks.
> - All quarks are bound together by the strong nuclear force.

> [!Info] More on quarks and stuff
> - The name comes from an american physicist called Murray Gell-Mann in the 1960s. He took this name from James Joyce's novel, "Finnegans Wake".
> - Quarks, like [[Leptons]] are the building blocks of all matter. They are the most simple of particles and are classified as fundamental particles.
> - There are six types of quark and make up all of the hundreds of discovered [[Hadrons]].
> - Quark have antimatter counterparts â€“ [[Antiquarks]].

> [!Info] Proton and Neutron Structure
> - Proton has a positive charge of +1, $\therefore$ a proton has a quark structure of **up, up down**.
> - Neutron has a neutral charge of 0, $\therefore$ a neutron has a quark structure of **up, down, down**.

> [!Info] Leptons and Quarks
> - Leptons are *not* made out of quarks.
