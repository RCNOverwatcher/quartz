# Isotopes

> [!Info] Isotopes
> - Isotopes are elements with a greater number of neutrons to protons
> - Changing the number of neutrons does *not* affect the properties of the element
> - However, changing the number of neutrons *does* affect the stability of the element
> - The greater number of neutrons to protons, means that the atom is more unstable
> - Unstable elements decay via radioactivity to become more stable
