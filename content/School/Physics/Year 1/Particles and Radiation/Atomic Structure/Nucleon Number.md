# Nucleon Number

> [!Info] The Nucleon Number
> - The nucleon number, also called the mass number, has the symbol $A$
> - Shows how many protons and neutrons combined are in the atom
> - Since each proton and neutron has a relative mass of 1, and the electrons have a very small mass, the nucleon number is a good estimator of the actual mass of the atom
> - Nuclide notation summarises all the information about an atom
> - $_{z}^aX$ where A is the nucleon number, Z is the proton number and X is the element
