| Conservation  | Laws | Quantum Numbers | Conserved?                              |
|---------------|------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Baryon        | B    | +1/0/-1       | Conserved                               |
| Charge        | Q    | +1/0/-1       | Conserved                               |
| Lepton Number | L$_{e}$    | +1/0/-1       | Conserved                               |
| Lepton Muon   | L$_{\micro}$    | +1/0/-1       | Conserved                               |
| Strangeness    | S    | +2/+1/0/-1/-2 | Only when produced via the strong force |

$$p + p \to p + p + k^++k^-$$

$$k^{-}\to \mu^-+\overline{v_{\mu}}$$
B, 0 = 0 0 
Q, -1 = -1 0
L$_{e}$ , 0 = 0 0
L$_{\mu}$ , 0 = +1 -1
S, -1 = 0 0

Strangeness is different because this interaction is caused by the weak force and is therefore not conserved.
