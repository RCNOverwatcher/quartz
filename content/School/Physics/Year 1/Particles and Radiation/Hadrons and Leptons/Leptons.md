# Leptons

## About Leptons

> [!Info] Leptons
> Leptons are fundemental particles that do **not** feel the strong force. They only interact with other particles via the weak force (and a bit of the gravatational as well as the electromagnetic if its charged).





## Types of Lepton

> [!Info] Electrons
> - Rest mass of 0.511 MeV
> - Very stable and do not decay
> - Life time of 66,000 Y-years

> [!Info] Muons
> - Have the $\micro$ symbol.
>  - Are negetively charged like electrons
>  - Basically "heavy electrons" with a rest mass of 105.7 MeV
>  - Decay into electrons
>  - Exist for about 2.2$\micro$s, however they travel so fast that they appear to exist for a much longer time.

> [!Info] Neutrinos
> The electron and muon leptons each come with their own neutrino. Due to them being:
> - Not charged (neutral)
> - Having very little mass
> they dont do much. They only take part in weak interactions.
