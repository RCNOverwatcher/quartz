# Mesons

### **MESONS ARE A TYPE OF HADRON**

> [!Info] Mesons
> - Mesons interact with baryons via the strong force. They are **unstable** and we see lots of them in particle collisions.

>[!Info] Pions
>- Pions are the lightest of the mesons and have a rest mass energy of about 140MeV
>- Charged Pions decay into leptons and neutral pions typically decay into gamma photons
>- There are anti-particle versions of each pion and pions can be charged or neutral
>- Pions are the exchange particle for the strong nuclear force
>- $\pi$

> [!Info]  Kaons
> - These are much heavier and more unstable, so they have a very short life.
> - They have a rest mass energy at just under 500 MeV.
> - Kaons decay into pions!
> - Kaons are also [[Strange Particles]]!
