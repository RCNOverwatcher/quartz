# The Potential Divider

> [!Info]The Potential Divider 
> - At its simplest, a potential divider is a circuit with a voltage source and a couple of resistors in series. The potential difference across the voltage source (e.g. a battery) is split across the resistors in the ratio of the resistances.
> - You can use potential dividers to supply a potential difference, $V_{\text{out}}$ between zero and the potential difference across the power supply.
> - This can be useful, e.g. if you need a varying p.d. supply (see next page) or one that is at a lower p.d. than the power supply.
