# Circuit Diagrams

> [!Info] Series circuits
> - In a series circuit, voltage is not the same in each part of the circuit.
> ![[series.png|300]]
> - $V_{T}=V_{1}+V_{2}$
> - However the current is the same in all parts of the circuit.
> - [[Resistance]] is defined as $R_{T}=R_{1}+R_{2}$

> [!Info] Parallel Circuits 
> - In a parallel circuit, the voltage is the same across the circuit, however the current is not the same.
>   ![[Untitled 1.png|300]]
> - Current is given by the equation: $I_{T}=I_{1}+I_{2}$
> - Resistance is inverted: $\frac{1}{R_{T}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}$
> - We can also use: $R_{T}=\frac{R_{1}\times R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}$

> [!Tip] TIP: Restistors in parallel 
> - If two resistors are in parallel, and they have the same resistance, then you can just half the value of one of them.
> - E.G. Two 2 ohm resistors in parallel give a total resistance of 1 ohm.
> - E.G. Two 840 ohm resistors in parallel give a total resistance of 420 ohms.
