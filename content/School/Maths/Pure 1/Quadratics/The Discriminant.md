# The Discriminant

> [!Example]- Difficult Exam question: $(p-1)x^2+4x+(p-5)=0$ has no real roots. Show that $p$ satisfiys $p^2-6p+1>0$.
> Using discriminant: $4^2-4(p-1)(p-5)<0$
> $16-4(p^2-6p+5)<0$
> $16-4p^2+24p-20<0$
> $-4-4p^2+24p<0$
> Divide through by $-4$: $p^2-6p+1>0$
> 
> Now find all possible values for $p$
> Find roots:
> $p^2-6p+1=0$
> Roots are $3+2\sqrt{ 2 }$ and $3-2\sqrt{ 2 }$
> Draw the graph and show the inequality.
