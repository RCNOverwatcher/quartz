# Mathematical Proof

### A statment that has been proven is called a theorum.
### A statment that has yet to be proven is called a conjecture

> [!Info] Example of proof
> Statment: The product of two odd numbers is always odd
> 
> Demonstration: $5$ x $7 = 35$, which is odd
> 
> Proof: $x$ and $y$ are integers, therefore $(2x+1)$ and $(2y+1)$ are both odd integers
> $$(2x+1)(2y+1) = 4xy+2x+2y+1$$
> $$=2(2xy+x+y)+1$$
> Since x and y are integers, 2xy+x+y is also an integer
> So $2(2xy+x+y)+1$ is one more than an odd number
> So the product of two odd numbers is odd
