# Angles in all four Quadrants

## Cast Circle

![[DC-724V2-4126135703.png]] ^0929d1

> [!Info] The four quadrants
> - In the A quadrant (top right), sin, cos and tan are all positive
> - In the S quadrant (top left), only sin is positive
> - In the T quadrant, (bottom left), only tan is positive
> - In the C quadrant (bottom right), only cos is positive

> [!Info] REMEMBER: CAST DIAGRAM
> $$x^2+y^2=1$$
> 
> On a unit circle,
> - the sin() of an angle is the x co-ordinate of the point
> - the cos() of an angle is the y co-ordinate of the point
> - the tan() of an angle is the gradient of the line drawn to the point from the origin
