> $$n! = n(n-1)(n-2)\times\dots \times{3}\times 2\times 1$$

> [!Info] The number of ways of choosing r items from a group of n items
> $$^{n}C_{r} =\left( \frac{n}{r} \right)=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$

> - $^{n}C_{r}$ can be used to find a value in pascals triangle. This makes finding the co-efficients for binomial expansion much easier. 
> - **The rth entry in the nth row of pascals triangle is given by $^{n-1}C_{r-1}$**
