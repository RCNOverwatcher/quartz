# Exponential Modelling

> [!Info] Exponential Modelling
> - We use $e^x$ to model situations such as population growth, where the rate of increase is proportional to the size of the data set at any given moment in time.
> - Similarly, we can use $e^{-x}$ to model exponential decay such as radioactive half lives.

> [!Example]- Example: $P=160e^{0.006t}$ where $t$ is the time in days since the pesticide was first applied
> 1. Estimate $P$ after 15 days: $160e^{0.09} = 175.068$
> 2. Show that $\frac{dP}{dt}=kP$ where $k$ is a constant and state the value of $P$: $160\times -0.006e^{-0.006t}=-0.96e^{-0.006t}$
