# Vertical Motion due to Gravity

> [!Example]- Example 13
> **A ball $\mathbf{A}$ falls vertically from rest from the top of a tower 63 m high. At the same time as $\mathbf{A}$ begins to fall, another ball $\mathbf{B}$ is projected vertically upwards from the bottom of the tower with speed 21 ms$^{-1}$. The balls collide. Find the distance of the point where the balls collide from the bottom of the tower.**
> 
> - Motion for $\mathbf{A}$
> - $u = 0$
> - $a=9.8$
> - $s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$ (because we cant find $t$ right now we express in terms of $t$)
> - $s_{1}=4.9t^2$
> 
> - Motion for $\mathbf{B}$
> - $u=21$
> - $a=-9.8$
> - $s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$ (because we cant find $t$ right now we express in terms of $t$)
> - $s_{2}=21t-4.9t^2$
> 
> - $s_{\text{total}}=63$
> - $63=4.9t^2-4.9t^2+21t$
> - $21t=63$
> - So it takes the two balls 3 seconds to collide.
> 
> - Find distance FROM BOTTOM of the tower
> - $s_{2}=21t-4.9t^2$
> - $s_{2}=21\times3-4.9\times9$
> - $s_{2}=18.9$
