# Forces as Vectors 

> [!Info] Forces as Vectors 
> - When there is no overall vector movement, (0i+0j), the object/particle is in equailibrium.

> [!Example]- Particle at rest begins on the origin.
> - Three forces: 2i+j, 3i-2j, -i+4j
> - Resultant force = $(2+3-1)i, (1-2+4)j = 4i+3j$
> - Magnitude = $\sqrt{ 4^2+3^2 }=5$
> - Bearing = $\tan^{-1}\frac{3}{4}=36.9^{\circ}$, $90-36.9=53.1^\circ$
