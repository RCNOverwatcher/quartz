> - $$s=\int v \, dt $$
> - $$v=\int a \, dt $$

> [!Example]- A particle is moving along the x-axis. At time $t=0$, the particle is at $x=5$. The velocity is given by the equation: $6t-t^2$.
> - $\int 6t-t^2\, dt$
>  =$3t^2-\frac{t^3}{3}+c$
>  - $c=5$
>  - $3t^2-\frac{t^3}{3}+5$
>  - When $t=6$, $x=41-5=36$
