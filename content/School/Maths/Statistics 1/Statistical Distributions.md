# Statistical Distribution 

> [!Tip] The Binomial Distribution 
> $$P(X=r)=\begin{pmatrix}n \\r\end{pmatrix}p^r(1-p)^{n-r}$$
> Where:
> 	- $X$ is the description of the random variable
> 	- $p$ is the [[Probability|probability]] 
> 	- $n$ is the number of trials

> [!Example]- Cumulative Probabilities
> Using $X\sim B(20,0.4)$
> 1. $P(X\leq7)=0.4159$
> 2. $P(X<6)=P(X\leq5)=0.1256$
> 3. $P(X\geq15)=1-P(X\leq14)=0.0016$
>4. $P(6<X\leq10)=P(X\leq10)-P(X\leq6)$
>5. $P(X>20)=1-P(X\leq20)$
>6. $P(20<X<30)=P(X\leq29)-P(X\leq20)$

> [!Example]- Dealing with Probability Ranges
>a.  Prob that spinner lands on red is 0.3
> Jane does 12 spins
> Find the probability she gets at least 5 reds. = 0.276
> 
> b. Probability of winning a prize is < 0.05. Each member of the class will have 12 spins.
> How many reds are needed to win? - 7 reds (gives probability of 0.0386)

> [!Example]- Probability ranges example 2
> 20 exams at the end of the year 
> pass rate for each exam is 0.45.
> exam administrators want a certain number of exams to be passed to continue at school.
> How many test should students have to pass for the pass rate to be 90%.

> 1. 0.28 (lower = 0, upper = 1)
> 2. 0.1036 (lower = 5, upper=50)
> 3. d=5 because 5-50 prob is 0.10 (and when d=6, prob = 0.0377 which is when the factory stops so it needs to be GREATER than 5)
