# Applications to Modelling 

> [!Example]- The price of a car in Â£s, $x$ years after purchase, is modelled by the function $f(x)=15000(0.85)^x-1000\sin x$, $x>0$
>##### Find the value of the car 10 years after purchase
> - $15000(0.85)^{10}-1000\sin 10=3497.13$
> ---
> ##### Show that $f(x)$ has a root between 19 and 20
> $f(19)=543.11$
> $f(20)=-331.55$
> Sign changed therefore root is present.
> ---
> ##### Find $f^{'}(x)$
> - $(15000)(0.85)^x(\ln0.85)-1000\cos x$
> ---
> ##### Taking 19.5 as a first approximation, apply the Newton-Raphson Method once to $f(x)$ to obtain a second approximation for the time when the value of the car is zero. Give your answer to 3 d.p
> - $f(19.5)=25.06\dots$
> - $f^{'}(19.5)=-898.30\dots$
> - $x_{1}=x_{0}-\frac{f(x_{0})}{f^{'}(x_{0})}=19.528$
> ---
> ##### Criticise this model as the car gets older
> - A car cannot have a negative value, so this model is not reasonable.
