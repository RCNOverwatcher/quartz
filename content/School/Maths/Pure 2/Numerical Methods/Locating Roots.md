# Locating Roots

> [!Example]- $g(x)=e^{x-1}+x-6$
> - The root of $g(x)=0$ is $\alpha$
> - By choosing a suitable interval, show that $\alpha=2.307$ correct to 3dp
> ---
> - If correct to 3dp, the lowest value it can be is $2.3065$ and the highest it can be is $2.3075$
> 
> - $e^{1.3065}+2.3065-6=-0.000275$
> - $e^{1.3075}+2.3075-6=0.00442$
> 
> - There is a change in sign in this interval, $(2.3065, 2.3075)$

> [!Example]- Sketch $y=\ln x$ and $y=\frac{1}{x}$

>---
> Explain how the diagram shows that $y=\ln(x)-\frac{1}{x}$ has only one root 
>---
> - The lines intersect at $\ln x=\frac{1}{x}\therefore$ the roots of $\ln x-\frac{1}{x}=0$ correspond to the points of intersection 
> - There is only one point of intersection in the graph therefore there is only one root.
>---
> Show that the root lies between $1.7$ and $1.8$
>---
> - $\ln(1.7)-\frac{1}{1.7}=-0.0576$
> - $\ln(1.8)-\frac{1}{1.8}=0.0322$
> - There is a change in sign so there must be a root here.
>---
> Given that the root of $f(x)$ is $\alpha$, show that $\alpha=1.763$ correct to 3dp
>---
> - $f(1.7625)=-0.00064$
> - $f(1.7635)=0.00024$
> - Change in sign, therefore root is accurate to 3dp

> [!Example]- Show that the x-coordinate of $Q$ lies between 2.1 and 2.2
> - $2\cos\left( \frac{1}{2}\times2.2^2 \right)+2.2^3+(3\times2.2)-2=0.5464\dots$
> - $2\cos\left( \frac{1}{2}\times2.2^1 \right)+2.1^3+(3\times2.1)-2=-0.22407\dots$
