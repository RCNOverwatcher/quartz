# Parametric Equations 

>[!Info] Parametric Equations 
>- You can write the x and y coordinates of each point on a curve as functions of a third variable. 
>- This variable is called a parameter and is often represented by the letter $t$.
>- To convert from parametric form to cartesian form, we can find $t$ in terms of $x$ and the substitute this into the other parametric equation, eliminating $t$.

> [!Example] Example 1
> - Curve C has parametric equations:
> - $x=\ln(t+2)$
> - $y=\frac{1}{t+1}$
> - Find the cartesian equation:
> ---
> - $t=e^x-2$
> - $y=\frac{1}{e^x-1}$

> [!Example] Example 2 
> - Curve C has parametric equations:
> - $x=\ln t$
> - $y=t^2-2$
> - Find the cartesian equation:
> ---
> - $t=e^x$
> - $y=e^2x-1$

> [!Example] A curve C has parametric equations:
> - $x=2t-1$
> - $y=4t-7+\frac{3}{t}$
> ---
> - $t=\frac{x+1}{2}$
> - $y=4\left( \frac{x+1}{2} \right)-7+\frac{6}{x+1}$
> - $y=2x-5+\frac{6}{x+1}$
> - $y=\frac{(2x-5)(x+1)+6}{x+1}$
> - $y=\frac{2x^2-3x+1}{x+1}$

> [!Example]- Find the cartesian form of these parametric equations, including their domain and range.
> 1. $x=2t+1$, $y=\frac{1}{t}$, $t>0$
> 	$y=\frac{2}{x-1}$
> 	Domain: $x>1$
> 	Range: $y>0$
> ---
> 2. $x=\frac{1}{t-2}$, $y=t^2$, $t>2$
> 	$y=\frac{1}{x^2}+4$
> 	Domain: $x>0$
> 	Range: $y\geq4$
