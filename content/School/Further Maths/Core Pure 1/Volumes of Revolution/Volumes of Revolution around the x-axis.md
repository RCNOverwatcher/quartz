# Volumes of Revolution around the x-axis

> [!Info] Volumes of Revolution 
> - You can use [[School/Maths/Pure 1/Integration]] to find volumes of revolution such as cones.
> - If we have a diagonal line and rotate it around the x-axis, the 3d shape formed is a cone.
> - Instead of summing an infinite amount of rectangles in normal integration, we instead sum an infinite amount of circular strips.

>  - The equation for a volume of revolution is: $$V=\pi \int ^a_{b}y^2 \, dx $$

> [!Info] Deriving the equation of a sphere
> - If we have a circle of equation $x^2+y^2=R^2$ we can rearrange this to be $y^2=R^2-x^2$.
> - We are now integrating between $R$ and $-R$.
> - $V=\pi\int ^R_{-R}y^2 \, dx$
> - $V=\pi\int ^R_{-R}R^2-x^2 \, dx$
> - $\pi\left[ R^2x-\frac{1}{3}x^3 \right]^R_{-R}$
> - $\pi\left[ \left( R^3-\frac{1}{3}R^3 \right)-\left( -R^3+\frac{1}{3}R^3 \right) \right]$
> - $\pi\left( \frac{6}{3}R^3 -\frac{2}{3}R^3\right)$
> - $\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3$

> [!Example]- $y=10x^2$ between $x=0$ and $x=2$
> - $V=\pi \int ^2_{0}10x^2 \, dx$
