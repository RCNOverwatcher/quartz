# Conservation of mechanical energy and work-energy principle 

> [!Info] 
> - When no external forces (other than gravity) do work on a particle during its motion, the sum of the particle's kinetic energy and potential energy remains constant.
> - The change in the total energy of a particle is equal to the work done on the particle.

> [!Tip] 
> - Initial Energy = Final Energy 
> - $$\text{Work in}+\text{initial K.E.}+\text{initial G.P.E.}=\text{Final K.E.}+\text{Final G.P.E}+\text{Work out}$$
> - $$\text{driving force}\times \text{distance}+\frac{1}{2}mu^2+mgh_{1}=\frac{1}{2}mv^2+mgh_{2}+\text{resistance}\times \text{distance}$$
