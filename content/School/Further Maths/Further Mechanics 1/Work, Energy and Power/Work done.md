# Work done


> [!Tip] Equations 
> - $$1J=1Nm$$

> [!Info]- The force $Y$N moves a particle, mass $m$kg, $x$m up a rough slope inclined at $30^{\circ}$ to the horizontal.
> - $\text{work done}=\Delta gpe$
> - Some of this work is done against friction (transferred to heat): $F_{r}x$ 
> - Some of this work is done against gravity: $=x\times mg\sin(30)$

> [!Example]- A package of mass 2kg is pulled at a constant speed up a rough plane which is inclined at $30^{\circ}$ to the horizontal. The coefficient of friction is $0.35$. The package is drawn 12m up the slope.
> - Angle: $30^{\circ}$
> - Weight: $2g (2\times9.81)$
> ---
> - Work done against gravity = $2g\times \sin30\times12=g\times12=12g$
> ---
> - Work done against friction $= \mu \times R$ where $\mu$ is the coefficient of friction
> - $R-2g\cos30$ because forces must be equal 
> - Therefore $R=\sqrt{ 3 }g$ N
> - Work done against friction: $=\sqrt{ 3 }g\times0.35$
> ---
> - Total work done by the pulling force: $(\sqrt{ 3 }g\times0.35)+12g$ (work done against both of the above added together)
