# Power 

> [!Tip] Power Equation 
> $$\text{power}=\frac{\text{energy}}{\text{time}}=\frac{\text{force}\times \text{distance}}{\text{time}}=\text{force}\times \text{speed}$$
> $$P=\frac{Q}{t}$$
> $$P=Fv$$

> [!Tip] Addition to the work energy principle 
> - $\text{driving force}=\frac{\text{power}}{\text{speed}}$

> [!Example]- A van of mass 1250kg is travelling along a horizontal road. The van's engine is working at 24kW. The constant resistance to motion has a magnitude of 600N. Calculate the acceleration of the van when it is travelling at 6m/s and the maximum speed of the van.
> - $P=Fv$
> - $F=\frac{24000}{6}=4000$
> - $4000-600=1250a$
> - $a=\frac{3400}{1250}=2.72m/s^2$
> ---
> - When the van is at maximum speed, the driving force is the same as the resistance force.
> - $P=24kW$
> - $2400=600v$
> - $v=\frac{240}{6}=40$

> [!Example]- A car of mass 1200kg is moving along a straight horizonal road against a resistance of 500N. 
> - Find the power developed by the engine when the car is travelling at $15ms^{-1}$ and accelerating at $0.25ms^{-2}$
> - $P=Fv$
> - $F=ma$
> - $F=1200\times0.25=300N\text{ and then }+500N=800N$
> - $P=800\times15=12000W$
> ---
> - Find the maximum speed reached by the car if the engine continues to work at this rate.
> - $P=Fv$
> - When car is at maximum speed, there is no acceleration, therefore driving force is equal to resistance force.
> - $12000=500v$
> - $v=24ms^{-1}$

> [!Example]- A motor cyclist is riding along a straight horizontal road at a constant speed of $15ms^{-1}$. The resistance to motion is $80N$.
> - Find the power developed by the engine.
> - $P=Fv$
> - $P=80\times15=1200W$
> ----
> - Given that the mass of the motorcycle is 200kg, find the initial acceleration when the power is increased to 1500W.
> - $a=\frac{F}{m}$
> - $F=\frac{P}{v}$
> - $F=\frac{1500}{15}=100$
> - Resolving forces: $100-80=20$
> - $a=\frac{F}{m}=\frac{20}{200}=0.1ms^{-2}$

> [!Example]- A lorry with mass 2.4 tonnes moves at a steady speed of $60kmh^{-1}$ against a constant frictional force of 2000N. Find the power developed by the engine when it is moving:
> 1. along a straight horizontal road
