## Activity networks

> [!Info] 
> - On Activity Networks (also called arc networks), the arcs are referred to as activities, and the nodes represent the completion of the task.
> - Each arc/task is labelled with a letter to represent it and the arrow is used to define the direction. The nodes are numbered starting from 0 (or 1).
> - The first node is called the source node. 
> - You have to number each node as it is added to the network.
> - The final node is called the sink node.
