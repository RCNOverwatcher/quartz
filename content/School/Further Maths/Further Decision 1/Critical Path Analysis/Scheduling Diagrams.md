# Scheduling Diagrams

> [!Info] Scheduling Diagrams
> - The process of assigning workers to tasks is known as scheduling.
> - It is important to know how to construct a scheduling diagram, to show which workers should be assigned to which activities.
> - When you are scheduling an activity, you should **always use the first avaliable worker** and if there is a choice of activities for a worker, assign the one with the lowest late time value.

> [!Example]- Question 1
> 1. $22 \times 3=66$
> -Project time is$64$
> $\therefore$ lower bound should be 3 workers
> 2. B has a float of 3, therefore a delay of 2 hours should not change the overall planning structure.
> 3. J and H must be happening at 17.5 hours into the project
