# Review Exercise 1

> [!Example]- Question 1
> ![[Pasted image 20221214102259.png|300]]
> 1. When $a=645$ and $b=255$, $c=2.53$ to 2dp.
>     $d=2$
>     $e=db=510$
>     $f=a-e=135$
>     $a=255$
>     $b=135$
>     $c=1.89$
>     $d=1$
>     $e=db=135$
>     $f=a-e=120$
>     $a=135$
>     $b=120$
>     $c=1.13$
>     $d=1$
>     $e=db=120$
>     $f=a-e=15$
>     $a=b=120$
>     $b=15$
>     $c=8$
>     $d=8$
>     $e=db=120$
>     $f=a-e=0$
>     $f=0$ therefore answer is $15$.
>     STOP

>2. Since $a$ is less than $b$, $d$ would be equal to 0 and $b$ would be set to $a$ and $a$ would be set to $b$.
>   This would result in the numbers being swapped and the pattern in the previous question happening.
>   
>   3. This flow chart finds the highest common factor of two numbers.

> [!Example]- Question 2
> 1. Lower bound of 4, because all lengths added up = 390cm.
> 2. 80 in the first bin, 65 in the second bin, 75 in the third bin, 55 in the fourth bin, 60 in the fifth bin, 55 in the sixth bin.
> 3. 100 in the first bin, 100 in the second bin, 80 in the third bin, 55 in the fourth bin, 55 in the fifth bin.
> 4. First two bins are maxed out, and no combination of the last 5 planks can do better than 5 bins.

> [!Example]- Question 3
> 55, 80, 25, 84, 25, 34, 17, 75, 3, 5
