# Linked Lists

### What is a linked list?
A linked list is an example of a data structure, a structure that a programmer sets up in code. Once set up, the programmer can then add data to it, search for data in it and find data in it to amend or delete. Linked lists are dynamic data structures - they shrink and grow, depending on how much data needs to be stored. They can be an almost unlimited size, although they are often set up inside an array, which is in some programming languages a fixed size.
