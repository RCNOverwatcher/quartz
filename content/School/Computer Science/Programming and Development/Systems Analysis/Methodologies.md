# Methodologies


> [!Info] The Waterfall Method 
> - The Waterfall Method is a type of software development that focuses on a set lifecycle.
> - In each stage, there is a set of activities that must happen in a certain order, and a set of outcomes (called 'deliverables') that must be produced and signed off as completed by the Project Manager for each stage before the next one is started.
> - An example of a Deliverable is a report or documentation.
>  ![[nrhwhadz.bmp]]
>  - Notice with this model that there is nothing stopping a stage feeding back into an earlier stage, so that the project can constantly loop around until it is perfect!

> [!Info] The Aglile Method 
> - The Agile methodology focuses heavy on delivering small working pieces of code that can be easily implemented into a larger codebase.
> - This approach has blown up as a result of Object Orientated Programming because of the modular nature of the code.
> - Agile has a set of values to follow:
> 	- **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**
>	-  **Working software over comprehensive documentation**
> 	- **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**
> 	- **Responding to change over following a plan.**
> 
> - These are only rough guidelines.
> - The Agile methodology is iteritive and goes round and round until the project is complete.
	
> [!Info] Extreme Programming (XP)
> 1.  Work on one thing at a time, incrementally.
    > 2.  Release as many small releases as possible, as quickly as possible, to get as much feedback as possible.
    > 3.  Use metaphors in documentation e.g. the Shopping Cart' is often used as a metaphor for the online shopping experience.
    > 4.  Always use the simplest design to get the function working. Don't add things that may not be used.
    > 5.  Test everything. Use automatic testing if possible.
    > 6.  Design as you go, making improvements when you need to.
    > 7.  Program in pairs or small groups, to allow discussions about requirements, designs, coding, testing etc.
    > 8.  Anyone on the team can make a change to code at any time - everyone owns the code.
    > 9.  The entire product is constantly being tested as new parts are added.
    > 10.  The teams should not be stressed out when they work, trying to meet unrealistic deadlines by working late and weekends and not seeing their families, for example.
    > 11.  Everyone in the team should aim to be able to do anything that needs doing; generalisation rather than specialisation of team members.
    > 12.  Everyone in the team should know and follow whatever standards are agreed.
    > 13.  Aim for constant and direct customer access, to facilitate feedback and general communications.
    > 
    > - XP is different to other Agile Methodologies in that it has an iteration time of from one to four weeks for each production of software.
    > - XP focuses heavily on the aspect of Agile that involves delivering small working packets of code.
    > - It also uses lots of storyboards which allow prioritisation of tasks and due to it being object orientated, it doesnt require a linear approach.
    > - However the lack of a linear approach may make it hard for a customer to understand the methodology.
