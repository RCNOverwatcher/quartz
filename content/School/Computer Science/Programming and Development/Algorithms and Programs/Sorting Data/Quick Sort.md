# Quick Sort



### A very quick way to sort a set of data is to use the quicksort algorithm. 

#### The algorithm performs the following functions on a set of data:

> [!Info] Quick Sort Algorithm
> It selects one of the pieces of data in the set of data to be sorted, called the ‘**PIVOT**’.
> It makes a pass through all the data items. At the end of the pass, **three things will have happened**:
> 1. The PIVOT will be positioned correctly.
> 2. Data items less than the PIVOT will be on the left of it.
> 3. Data items greater than the PIVOT will be on the right of it.
>    
> The quicksort algorithm is then applied recursively to the left of the PIVOT.
> The quicksort algorithm is then applied recursively to the right of the PIVOT.
