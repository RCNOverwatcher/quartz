> [!info] Types of errors
> When a programmer writes a program, errors are sometimes made in the code. Finding errors, or ‘bugs’, in a program is known as ‘debugging’ a program. Errors can be classified under the three headings.
> 1. Syntax errors
> 2. Logic errors
> 3. Runtime errors
>- 
>1. 
>- Syntax errors are caught by the compiler or interpreter at runtime.
>- E.G. **Print(“Hello world”)**
>- This would throw an error because the print statement begins with a captial P in this program which is not a correct command.
>2. 
>- Logic errors are usually arithmatic errors that are not caught at runtime. An example of this is trying to divide two numbers and using the + symbol.
>- This would not catch an error, but the program wouldn't do what you wanted to.
>3. 
>   - Unlike logical errors, Runtime errors will cause the program will stop running and a run-time error will be displayed. A typical example of a run-time error is when a division by zero occurs in a calculation.
>   - Dividing by zero is a meaningless calculation. Impossible arithmetic operations that result in errors are also called arithmetic errors.
