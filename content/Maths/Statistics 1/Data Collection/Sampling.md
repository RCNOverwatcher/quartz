## Types of Sampling 

> [!Info] Simple random sampling 
> - In simple random sampling, every sample has an equal chance of being selected.
> - Use a random number generator or lottery sampling (names in a hat)
> 
> - This type of sampling is bias free and easy to implement. However it becomes unsuitable when your sample size becomes too high.

> [!Info] Systematic Sampling 
> - Systematic sampling gives an evenly spread distribution. To do this randomly, you should have a randomly generated offset. Samples are chosen at set and evenly spaced intervals.
> $$k=\frac{population (N)}{sample(n)}$$
> (starting at a random item between 1 and $k$)

> [!Info] Stratified Sampling 
> - Stratified sampling is population divided into groups called *strata* and a simple random sample from each strata.
> - The same proportion of people should be selected from each strata.
>  - This method has many advantages because it guarentees proportional representation.
