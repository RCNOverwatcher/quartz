> [!Example]- In the UK, 5% of students turn up to school late. Mr McCarty wishes to determine, to a 10% significence level, if Richard Hale has a problem with attendance. $\frac{6}{40}$ students who pass him one day are late.
> Suitable test statistic: 
> 	   H$_{0}$ P=0.05
> 	   H$_{1}>0.05$
> 	  $P(N\geq n)=1-P(N\leq4)=0.048$
> 	  Therefore there is sufficient evidence to reject H$_{0}$ and conclude that there is a problem with attendance at Richard Hale.
