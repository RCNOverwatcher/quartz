# Mutually Exclusive and Independent Events

> [!Info] Mutually Exclusive Events 
> - $\mathbf{P(A \cap B)}=0$
> - $\mathbf{P(A \cup B)}=\mathbf{P(A) + P(B)}$

> [!Info] Independent Events 
> - If an event is independent, then whether one event happens does not affect the probability of the other event happening.
> - If $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are independent then the probability of $\mathbf{A\cap B}$ is equal to $\mathbf{P(A)\times \mathbf{P(B)}}$
