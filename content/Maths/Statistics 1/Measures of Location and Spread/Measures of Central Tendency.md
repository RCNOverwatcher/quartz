# Measures of Central Tendency

> [!Info] Some different measures of central tendency 
> - Measures of central tendency is a fancy way of saying...: 
> - Mean: Add up all your results and divide by the number od bits of data 
> - Mode: Most common data point 
> - Median: The middle most point when data is ordered

> [!Tip] Fancy way of writing mean
> $\overline{x}$ is a fancy way of writing the mean (xbar)

> [!Info] Calculating medians
> - For medians in listed data, find $\frac{n}{2}$
> - If it's a decimal, round up
> - If it's a whole number, use the number halfway between this item and the one after.
> 
> - For grouped data. you add up everything and divide by 2.
> - E.G. Grouped data frequency total = 17, so we divide by 2 to get the position to use as 8.5
> - This is the same as for listed data ($\frac{n}{2}$) but we then use linear interpolation.

> [!Info] More complicated medians for grouped data 
> - If we assume the 7th person has an iq of 90 (upper bound)
> - If we assume the 12th person has an iq of 100 (upper bound)
> - This means that we can use ratios to work out the medians 
> - We know we are looking for the 8.5th piece of data 
> - The denominator in our equation is the difference between the two bounds (12-7=5) (100-90=10)
> - $\frac{x-90}{10}=\frac{8.5-7}{5}$
> - $x-90=3$
> - $x=93$
> - This is our median estimate and this process is called linear interpolation.

> [!Tip] Linear Interpolation equation 
>  - $\frac{median - \text{Lower data bound}}{\text{upper data bound - lower data bound}}=\frac{\text{median position}-\text{lower frequency bound}}{\text{upper frequency bound}-\text{lower frequency bound}}$

> [!Example]- Weight of cat
> - Median class interval is in the $3\leq w<4$ range
> - $\frac{w-3}{1}=\frac{16-10}{18}$
> - $w-3=\frac{6}{18}$
> - $w=3 \frac{1}{3}$

> [!Example]- Time (in seconds)
> - Median class interval is in the $12\leq t<14$ range 
> - $\frac{t-12}{2}=\frac{10-7}{13}$
> - $\frac{t-12}{2}=\frac{3}{13}$
> - $t-12=\frac{6}{13}$
> - $t=12 \frac{6}{13}$
