# Coding

> [!Info] Coding 
> - In coding, we change the data set in some way to make it easier to process.
> - Linear coding involves $+, -, \times, \div$.

> [!Tip] Rules of coding 
> - Addition and subtraction have no effect on the standard deviation, however they do have an effect on the mean.

> - Finally, if we have multiple operations, e.g. $y=2x-5$, the multiplication takes effect on the standard deviation but the subtraction has no effect. This would mean the standard deviation would be the same as $y=2x$ without the subtraction. However, the mean would have both operations applied, meaning the mean of $y$ would now be the mean of $x$ but timesed by 2 and subtracted 5.
