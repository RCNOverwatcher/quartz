# Functions and Mappings

> [!Info] Mappings 
> - A mapping is a function if every input has a distinct output. Functions can either be one to one or many to one.
> - One to many is not a function.
> - You can convert a mapping into a function by restricting the domain.

> [!Info] Domain and range. 
> - The domain is the number you start with and the range is the number/numbers you end with.
> - AKA: The domain is where a function starts, and the range is where the function finishes.

> [!Example] Examples of [[Functions]] 
> - $x+1$ is a one to one function. (e.g. $5\to6$)
> - $x^2$ is a many to one function. (e.g. $2\to4$ and $-2\to4$)
> - $\sqrt{ x }$ is a one to many function. (e.g. $4\to -2\text{ or }2$)

> - You cannot square root a negative number therefore we restrict the domain to $x\geq0$. This is because if we apply this function to values less than 0, we dont get a value at all.

> [!Info] Set Notation
> - Always use curly brackets: {}
> - Inside these brackets, we put a range of values for which $x$ is applicable.
> - E.G. $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ (integer), $x \in \mathbb{R}$ (rational)
> - To seperate statements inside set notation we use commas (,)
