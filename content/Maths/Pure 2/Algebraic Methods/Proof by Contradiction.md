# Proof by Contradiction

> [!Example]- Use Proof by Contradiction to show that there exists no integers x and y for which 6x+9y=1.
> 1. There are integers x and y for which 6x+9y=1.
> 2. If $6x+9y=1$, then $2x+3y=\frac{1}{3}$
> 3. This means that there cannot be integers x and y that meet this criteria as the sum of two integers will always be another integer.

> [!Example]- Use Proof by Contradiction to show that there exists no integers $x$ and $y$ for which $30x+20y=7$.
> 1. There exists integers $x$ and $y$ for which $10x+30y=7$
> 2. $3x+2y=\frac{7}{10}$
> 3. This means that there cannot be integers x and y that meet this criteria as the sum of two integers will always be another integer.

> [!Example]- Use Proof by Contradiction to show that $\sqrt{ 3 }$ is irrational.
> 1. $\sqrt{ 3 }$ is rational, meaning it can be expressed in the form $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers in their simplest form, with no common factors.
> 2. $3=\frac{a^2}{b^2}$
> 	$3b^2=a^2$
> 	$a^{2}$ is a multiple of 3, meaning $a$ is a multiple of 3 too.
> 	$a=3k$
> 	
> 	$3k^2=3b^2$
> 	$9k^2=3b^2$
> 	$b^2=3k^2$
> 	This means $b^2$ is a multiple of 3, meaning $b$ is a multiple of 3.
> 	
> 	If $a$ and $b$ are both multiples of 3, this contradicts our original statement that $a$ and $b$ have no common factors.
> 	Therefore $\sqrt{ 3 }$ is irrational.

> [!Example]- Use Proof by Contradiction to prove that the sum of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational.
> 1. The sum of a rational number and an irrational number is rational.
> 2. Let rational number = $\frac{a}{b}$ , our irrational number = $c$ where $c \neq \mathbb{Q}$ and our sum = $\frac{d}{e}$
> 	$\frac{a}{b}+c=\frac{d}{e}$
> 	$c=\frac{d}{e}-\frac{a}{b}$
> 	$c=\frac{ab-ae}{eb}$
> 	This means $c$ would be rational, which contradicts our original statement that $c \neq \mathbb{Q}$

> [!Example]- Use Proof by Contradiction to show that $\sqrt{ 2 }$ is irrational 
> - If $\sqrt{ 2 }$ is rational then it can be expressed in the form $\frac{a}{b}$ where a and b are integers 
> - So $2=\frac{a^2}{b^2}$
> - So $a^2=2b^2$
> - Since 2 is even, $a^2$ must be even. 
> - This means that $a$ must also be even.
> - If a is even, then it can be expressed in the form $2n$
> - So this can be written as $(2n)^2=2b^2$
> - $4n^2=2b^2$
> - This means that $b^2$ must be even, which means that $b$ must also be even.
> - If $a$ and $b$ are both divisible by 2, then they have a common factor of 2. This contradicts our original statement that $a$ and $b$ do not have any common factors and proves that $\sqrt{ 2 }$ is irrational.
