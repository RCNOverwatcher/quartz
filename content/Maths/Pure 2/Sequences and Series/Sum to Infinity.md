# Sum to Infinity

> [!Tip] Sum to Infinity
> $$\frac{a}{1-r}$$
> - $a$ is the first time in the sequence 
> - $r$ is the common ratio 

> [!Example]- Second and Third term of a sequence is 192 and 144
> - $r=\frac{144}{192}=\frac{3}{4}$
> - $\frac{144}{a}=\frac{192}{144}$
> - $a=256$
> - We can apply sum to infinity for this because the modulus of the common ratio is less than 1
> - $\frac{a}{1-r}$
> - $\frac{256}{1-\frac{3}{4}}$
> - $\Sigma\to\infty=1024$
