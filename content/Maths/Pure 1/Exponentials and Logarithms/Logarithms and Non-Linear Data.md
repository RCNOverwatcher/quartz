# Logarithms and Non-Linear Data

> [!Example]- Example 19
> - First we rearrange $P=aR^n$.
> - $\log P=\log(aR^n)$
> - Use the multiplication law: $\log P=\log a+\log R^n$
> - Use the other law: $\log P=\log a+n\log R$
> - Rearrange into $y=mx+c$ form: $\log P= n\log R+\log a$

>-  Now we have to estimate $a$ and $n$.
> - $a$ is where the line on the graph intercepts the y axis. This means that $a=6.2$.
> - $n$ is the gradient on the graph, therefore $n=-0.67$ on here.
