> - This graph ($y=e^x$), has the same differentiated function **and** integrated function, meaning the area under the graph at a certain point **and** the gradient of the graoh at the same point are the same.
>   
>   - If you do a graph of $y=e^{-x}$ then the graph will be **reflected in the y-axis**.
>   - A greater exponent, (e.g. $y=e^{4x}$), will make the graph be **more squished**.
>   - A fractional exponent, (e.g. $y=e^{\frac{1}{2}x}$), will make the graph **more spread out**.
>   - A multiplier inside the function, (e.g. $y=4e^x$), will make the graph **steeper** or flatter. (in this case, the y intercept would be 4).
