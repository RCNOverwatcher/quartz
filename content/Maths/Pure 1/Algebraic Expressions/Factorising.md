# Factorising

>[!Info]  Factorising
>- You can write expressions as a product of their factors
>- Factorising is the opposite of expanding brackets

### Quadratics

>[!Info] Factorising a Quadratic
>- Find two factors of $ac$ that add up to $b$
>- Rewrite the b term as a sum of these two factors
>- Factorise each pair of terms
>- Take out the common factor

>[!Example]- Example
>- $2x^2+5x-3$
>- $2$ x $-3 = -6$
>- 6 and -1 are factors of ac and add to b
>- We can rewrite this as $(2x-1)(x+3)$ because 2x times by 3 makes 6x

> [!Example]- $25x-9x^3$
> - Take out x as a factor: $x(25-9x^2)$
> - Factorise the quadratic using DOTS: $x(5+3x)(5-3x)$
> - Fully factorised.
