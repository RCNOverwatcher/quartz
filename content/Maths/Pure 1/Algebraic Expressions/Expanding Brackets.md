# Expanding Brackets

>[!Info] Expanding Brackets
>- To find the product of two expressions, you multiply each term in one expression, but each term in the other expression.
>- E.G. $(x+y)^4 = (x+y)(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)$

> [!Example]- Difficult exam question: $x\left( 2x^{-\frac{1}{4}} \right)^4$
> - Expand by applying the outer fourth power
> - $x(16x^{-1})$
> - $x$ and $x^{-1}$ cancel out.
> - $16$
