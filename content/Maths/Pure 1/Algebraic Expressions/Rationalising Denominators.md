# Rationalising Denominators

> [!Info] The rules
> - For fractions in the form $1\over \sqrt{a}$, multiply the numberator and the denominator by $\sqrt{a}$.
> - For fractions in the form$1\over a+\sqrt{b}$, multiply the numerator and the denominator by $a-\sqrt{b}$.
> - For fractions in the form$1\over a-\sqrt{b}$, multiply the numerator and the denominator by $a+\sqrt{b}$.
