# Negitive and fractional indices

### The laws

>[!Info] More laws of indices
>- $a^\frac{1}{m} = \sqrt[m]{a}$
>- $a^\frac{n}{m} = \sqrt[m]{a^n}$
>- $a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^m}$
>- $a^0 = 1$

### Negitive/Fractional Indices

>[!Info] Negitive/Fractional Indices
>- Negitive Indices act as a reciprocal power
>- E.G. $5^{-2} = \frac{1}{25}$
>- Fractional Indices act as a square and a root simultaneously
>- E.G. $125^{2/3} = 5^2 = 25$
