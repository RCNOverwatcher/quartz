# Methods of Proof

### Exhaustion

>[!Info] Sum of consecutive square numbers between 100 and 200
>100, 121, 144, 169, 196
>- 100+121 = odd
>- 121+144 = odd
>- 144+169 = odd
>- 169+196 = odd

### Counter Example

> [!Info] Sum of two consecutive prime numbers is always even
> 2+3=5 is odd
> $\therefore$ this is **not** true.

>[!Info] $\frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{x} \ge 2$
