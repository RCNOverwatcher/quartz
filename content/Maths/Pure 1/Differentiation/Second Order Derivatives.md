# Second Order Derivatives

> [!Info] Second order derivatives
> - You can get second order derivatives by differentiating twice (aka. differentiating the gradient function of your original function)
> - This can be used to find acceleration from displacement, as acceleration is metres per second, per second.

> [!Example]- If $y=5x^3-\frac{x}{3\sqrt{ x }}$, find the second derivative.
> - $y=5x^3-\frac{x}{3\sqrt{ x }}$
> - $y=15x^2-\frac{1}{6}x^{\frac{1}{2}}$
> - $y=30x+\frac{1}{12}x^{\frac{3}{2}}$

> [!Example]- Find the least value of $f(x)=x^2-4x+9$
> 1. Differentiate: 
> - $f^{'}(x)=2x-4=0$
> - $x=2$
> - $f(2)=2^2-4(2)+9=5$
> - $y=5$ is the minimum value.
