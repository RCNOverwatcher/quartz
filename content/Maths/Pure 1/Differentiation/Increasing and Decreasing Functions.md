# Increasing and Decreasing Functions

> [!Info] Increasing and decreasing functions
> - Increasing functions have an positive gradient at all points on the curve.
> - Decreasing functions have a negetive gradient at all points on the curve.

> [!Example]- Show that $f(x)=x^3+6x^2+21x+2$ is increasing for all real values of $x$
> - $f(x)=x^3+6x^2+21x+2$
> - $f^{'}x=3x^2+12x+21$
> - $f^{'}(x)=3(x^2+4x+7)$
> - Completing the square: $3(x+2)^2+9$
> - Because $(x+2)^2$ is positive for all real values of $x$, $f(x)$ is increasing for all x .

> [!Example]- Show that $f(x)=x^3+16x-2$ is increasing for all real values of x.
> - $f(x)=x^3+16x-2$
> - $f^{'}(x)=3x^2+16$
> - Because $3 x^{2}+16$ is positive for all real values of $x$, $f(x)=x^3+16x-2$ is increasing for all real $x$.

> [!Example]- Find the interval on which the function $f(x)=x^3+6x^2-135x$ is decreasing.
> - $f(x)=x^3+6x^2-135x$
> - $f^{'}(x)=3x^2+12x-135$
> - Factorise out by 3: $3(x^2+4x-45)$
> - Set $\leq$ to 0: $x^2+4x-45\leq{0}$
> - Factorise: $(x+9)(x-5)\leq{0}$
> - $-9\leq x \leq 5$ is where the function is decreasing.
