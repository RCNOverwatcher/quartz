# Trigonometric Identities and equations practice problems

> [!Example]- Given that $\alpha$ is the acute angle such that $\tan\alpha=\frac{2}{5}$, find the exact value of $\cos\alpha$.
> On a triangle, if $\tan\alpha=\frac{2}{5}$ then the opposite length is 2, and the adjacent length is 5, using pythagoras, we can find that the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{ 29 }$.
> Now using SOHCAHTOA, we can find that $\cos\alpha=\frac{5}{\sqrt{ 29 }}$

> [!Example]- $\tan\theta=\frac{1}{2}$ and $\theta$ is acute. Show that $\cos^2\theta=\frac{4}{5}$.
> - This means that the opposite is $1$ and the adjacent is $2$. $\therefore$ the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{ 5 }$.
> - $\cos\theta=\frac{2}{\sqrt{ 5 }}$ 
> - $\frac{2}{\sqrt{ 5 }}^2=\frac{4}{5}$
> - $\therefore \cos^2\theta=\frac{4}{5}$
