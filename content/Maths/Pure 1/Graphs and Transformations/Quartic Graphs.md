# Quartic Graphs

> [!Info] Drawing Quartics
> - If the $x^4$ term is positive, then both the tails go upwards. Otherwise, they both go down.
> - In factorised form, you can easily find the roots.
> - E.G. $(x-5)(x+3)(x-2)(x+11)$, roots will be $5, -3, 2, -11$

> [!Example]- Sketch the curve with equation $y=x^2(x+1)(x-1)$
