# Cubic Graphs

> [!Example]- Drawing a Cubic
> - ##### Sketch the curve: $y=(2-x)(x+1)^2$
> - This curve has a negetive x value, therefore it will look like a y=-x line with a wobble.
> - The roots will be 2 and -1 and the y-intercept will be 2.
>
> - ##### Sketch the curve $y=(x-4)^3$
> - The curve has roots 4, 4, and 4 causing a point of inflection at 4
> - The curve as a y-intercept of -64.

> [!Example]- A cubic with limited roots
> - ##### Sketch the curve with equation: $y=(x-1)(x^2+x+1)$
> - -1 is the only root
> - The y-intercept is 1
> - We do not know where the wobble will be....
