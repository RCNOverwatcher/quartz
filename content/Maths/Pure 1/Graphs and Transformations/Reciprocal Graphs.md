# Reciprocal Graphs

> [!Info] Reciprocal Graphs
> - Reciprocal Graphs look like this
>  ![[Pasted image 20221205104211.png|500]]
>  - Reciprocal graphs have asymtotes at the line $x=0$ and $y=0$
>
>When you have a larger value on the numerator, the graph will be stretched outwards.

> [!Info]- Varients of reciprocal graphs
> - When you have a power on the $x$ term, the graph changes.
> - With the graph $y=\frac{1}{x^2}$, the graph has both curves in the upper half of the graph.
