# Constant Acceleration formulae 1

> [!Info] SUVAT Equations 
> - $s$ is displacement 
> - $u$ is initial velocity 
> - $v$ is final velocity 
> - $a$ is acceleration 
> - $t$ is time

> [!Tip] Equations 
> $$s=t(\frac{v+u}{2})$$
> $$v=u+at$$
> $$v^2=u^2+2as$$
> $$s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$$
> $$s=vt-\frac{1}{2}at^2$$
