# Linear Transformations in three dimensions

> [!Info] 3D Transformations 
> - You can use unit vectors in 3d too
> - If you have $i$, $j$ and $k$ as your unit vectors and have a reflection in the plane $z=0$, then our k componant will be negative.

> [!Example]- Rotate by angle $\theta$ about the y-axis

>  - It helps to imagine that you are standing on the blue line in this image and looking back at the two axis' and turning them like a wheel.

> [!Example]- Rotation in 3 dimentions
> - $\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2} & 0 & \frac{1}{2} \\0 & 1 & 0 \\-\frac{1}{2} & 0 & \frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2}\end{pmatrix}$
> - Compare this to the ones we saw in the image above and we get that this is a rotation in the y axis.
