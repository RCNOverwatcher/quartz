# Finding Perpendiculars

> [!Info] Finding perpendiculars steps (for parallel lines)
> - Take away one parallel vector from another
> - Write a new vector in terms of $\lambda-\mu$ ($t$) (This vector is perpendicular to the other two vectors)
> - Multiply this vector out to get a single vector. (? + ?t)
> - If we multiply this vector with the direction vector of our parallel lines, we get 0.
> - With this info, we can solve for $t$
> - Once we solve for $t$, we can sub this back in to our original perpendicular equation and find an equation for the vector of the distance between the two lines.
> - You can then use the magnitude equation $\sqrt{ a^2+b^2 +c^2}=\text{magnitude}$
> - We now have the distance bwteen the two vectors.

> [!Info] Finding perpendiculars steps (for any line)
> - Take away one parallel vector from another.
> - Write a new vector in the form $(?+?\lambda+?\mu)$
> - Call this vector $AB$
> - $AB\times \text{direction vector 1}=0$
> - $AB\times \text{direction vector 2}=0$
> - We can multiply this out and get two simultaneous equations to solve in terms of $\mu$ and $\lambda$.
> - By eliminating either of these variables we can find the other and the sub this back in to find the other.
> - Finally we go back to our original perpendicular equation in terms of $\mu$ and $\lambda$.
> - This gives us a final vector which we use the magnitude equation $\sqrt{ a^2+b^2 +c^2}=\text{magnitude}$
> - We now have the distance between the two vectors.

> [!Info] Finding perpendiculars steps (for a line and a point)
> - Multiply out your vector into a single vector equation.
> - Find the perpendicular equation by inverting the signs on the point vector and adding this to our single vector equation we multiplied out.
> - Call it AB
> - $AB\times \text{direction vector}=0$
> - Find $\lambda$
> - Find the full form of AB.
> - Find the magnitude.

> [!Info] Finding the distance from the origin to a plane.
>  $$\mathbf{r}.\mathbf{\hat{n}}=\mathbf{d}$$
>  - Where $\mathbf{r}$ is any point on our plane.
>  - Where $\mathbf{\hat{n}}$ is the normal vector of the plane.
>  - Where $\mathbf{d}$ is the shortest distance between a plane and the origin.

> [!Info] Finding the distance between any two points 
> $$\frac{\mathbf{x}.\mathbf{n}-\mathbf{d}}{|\mathbf{n}|}$$
> - Where $\mathbf{x}$ is the vector of the point.
> - Where $\mathbf{n}$ is the normal vector of the plane.
> - Where $\mathbf{d}$ is the constant of the plane.
> - Where $|\mathbf{n}|$ is the magnitude of the normal vector.
