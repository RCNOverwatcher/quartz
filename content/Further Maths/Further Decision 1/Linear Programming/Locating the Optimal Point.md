# Locating the Optimal Point

> [!Info] The objective line method
>- For the objective line method, you draw a line for the equation to maximise. We only care about the gradient, not the y-intercept.
>- We put our ruler on the line with this gradient, and we "fly" our ruler in towards the region, keeping the gradient the same.
>- When our ruler hits a point on the region, then this point is the optimal point.

> [!Example]- Example problem
> - For $x, y \geq0$
> - $3x+y\leq15$
> - $2x+5y\leq 20$
> 
> - Maximise:
>   a) $x+y$
>   b) $x+4y$
