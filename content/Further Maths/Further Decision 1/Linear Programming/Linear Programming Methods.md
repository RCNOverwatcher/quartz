# Linear Programming Methods

> [!Info] Intro to Linear Programming
> - Label the region R where $2x+y<=10$, $y<-1$ and $y<x$
> ![[Pasted image 20221129094030.png|600]]

> [!Example]- Mental exercise
> - Label the region R where $x>1000$, $y>500$, $x+2y<4000$ and $x<y$.

> 
> In this example, x = toy aarkvarks and y = toy donkeys produced by a toy company. In real life, a company might have a contract to produce a certain amount of products.
> The inequalities used to descibe the graph are called **constraints**.
> For this graph, any point inside the white area is valid and any point outside the white area is invalid
> 
> Now the problem, find the co-ordinates of the triangle of region R.
> - $A: (1000, 1500)$
> - $B: \left(  \frac{4000}{3}, \frac{4000}{3} \right)$
> - $C: (1000, 1000)$
> 
> For the most profit/items sold, B is the best due to x+y being the biggest out of the three points.
> 
> If Y, (donkeys) is priced higher, then A *could* be a better strategy.

> [!Example]- Another mental exercise
> - A company manafactures computer screens and phone screens.
> - Maximum daily output is 8000 screens.
> - It must make at least 1000 phone screens.
> - There must be at least twice as many phone screens as computer screens.
> - Write these constraints in algebraic form.
> 
> $x$ is phone screens
> $y$ is computer screens
> 
> - $x+y\leq8000$
> - $x\geq1000$
> - $x\geq 2y$

> 
> $A=(1000,0)$
> $B=(1000, 500)$
> $C=\left( \frac{16000}{3} , \frac{8000}{3}\right)$ (Simultaneous equations to solve)
> $D=(8000, 0)$
> 
> Greatest Profit (P=x+10y):
> $A=1000$
> $B=6000$
> $C=32,000$
> $D=8000$
> 
> In this type of problem, the answers HAVE to be integer values. This is because in a real life scenario you cannot have a fraction amount for products produced.
