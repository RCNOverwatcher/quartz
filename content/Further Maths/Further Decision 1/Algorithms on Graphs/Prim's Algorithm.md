# Prim's Algorithm

### Prim's algorithm is also used to find a minimum spanning tree

> [!Info] Prims Algorithm
> 1. Choose any vertex to start the minimum spanning tree.
> 2. Select an arc of least weight that joins a vertex not already in the tree (If there is a choice between two arcs of equal weight, then choose either).
> 3. Repeat step 2 until all the vertices are connected.
