# Direct impact and Newton's law of restitution

> [!Info] Newton's Other Law 
> - You can solve problems involving the direct impact of two particles by using the principle of conservation of momentum and Newton's law of restitution. 
> - A direct impact is a collision between particles which are moving along the same straight line. 
> - When two particles collide, their speeds after the collision depend upon the materials from which they are made. 
> - Newton's law of restitution (sometimes called Newton's experimental law) defines how the speeds of the particles after the collision depend on the nature of the particles as well as their speeds before the collision. 
> - This law only holds when the collision takes place in free space or on a smooth surface.

> [!Tip] Equation
> 
> $$e=\frac{\text{speed of seperation of particles}}{\text{speed of approach of particles}}$$
> 
> $$e=\frac{v_{2}-v_{1}}{u_{2}-u_{1}}$$
> 
> - Where $e$ is the coefficient of restitution between the particles, $0\leq e\leq1$
> - A perfectly elastic collision has $e=1$ and a perfectly inelastic collision has $e=0$
