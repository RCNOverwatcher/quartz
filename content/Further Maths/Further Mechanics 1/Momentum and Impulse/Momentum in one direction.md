# Momentum in one direction 

> [!Tip] Impulse 
> - If a constant force $F$ acts for time $t$ then we define the impulse of the force to be $Ft$

> [!Tip] Derivation of the Impulse Momentum Principle 
> - $$a=\frac{v-u}{t}$$
> - Substitute into $F=ma$: $$F=m\left( \frac{v-u}{t} \right)$$
> - Change to impulse: $$Ft=m(v-u)$$
> - Therefore: $$Ft=mv-mu$$
> - Or Impulse = final momentum - initial momentum
> - Impulse = change in momentum 

> [!Example]- Momentum Questions 
> 1. Ball: $0.5kg$
> 	Impulse: $15Ns$
> 	Impulse = $mv-mu$
> 	$15=0.5v-0$
> 	$v=30$

> 2. Ball: $0.3kg$
> 	Speed: $3.5ms^{-1}$
> 	Ball rebounds at right angles 
> 	Impulse exerted on the ball is $1.8Ns$
> 	Find the speed of the ball after it rebounds 
> 	$1.8=(0.3\times v)-(0.3\times3.5)$
> 	$0.75=0.3\times v$
> 	$v=2.5$

> 	Pushed with $0.4N$ for $1.5s$
> 	Find the speed at the end of the $1.5s$
> 	$0.6=0.2v-0$
> 	$v=3$
