# Conservation of Momentum 

> [!Tip] Conservation 
> $$m_{1}u_{1}+m_{2}u_{2}=m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}$$

> [!Example]- Example
> Before Collision
> - Ball 1: $2kg$, $4ms^{-1}$
> - Ball 2: $1kg$, $0ms^{-1}$
> ---
> After Collision:
> - Ball 1: $2kg$, $2ms^{-1}$
> - Ball 2: $1kg$, $?ms^{-1}$
> ---
> $2(4)+1(0)=2(2)+1(v)$
> $8=4+v$
> $v=4ms^{-1}$ 

> [!Example]- Exercise 1B Q1
> A particle P of mass $2kg$ is moving on a smooth horizontal plane with speed $4ms^{-1}$. It collides with a second particle Q of mass $1kg$ which is at rest. After the collision P has speed $2ms^{-1}$ and it continues to move in the same direction. Find the speed of Q after the collision.

> [!Example]- Exercise 1B Q2
> A railway truck of mass 25 tonnes moving at $4ms^{-1}$ collides with a stationary truck of mass 20 tonnes. As a result of the collision the trucks couple together.
> Find the common speed of the trucks after the collision.

> [!Example]- Exercise 1B Q3 
> Particles A and B have masses $0.5 kg$ and $0.2 kg$ respectively. They are moving with speeds $5ms^{-1}$ and $2ms^{-1}$ respectively in the same direction along the same straight line on a smooth horizontal surface when they collide. After the collision A continues to move in the same direction with speed $4ms^{-1}$. Find the speed of B after the collision.
